she worked for a rich man .
having finished the work , he went to bed .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV many times .
are you up ?
he was patient .
the oper@@ ation was really touch and go there for a@@ while but the doctor thinks he &apos;ll pu@@ ll through .
since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
