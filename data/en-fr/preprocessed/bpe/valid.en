I don &apos;t care if you &apos;re busy . please help me now .

I have a feeling you &apos;ll be a very good la@@ w@@ yer .
some people are reading some magaz@@ ines on the train .
let &apos;s take a trip .
I thought I was about to be cap@@ tu@@ red so I ran as fast as I could .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
is sugar can@@ e a fruit or a ve@@ get@@ able ?
I bought a cam@@ era for thirty dollars .
the house stood on the h@@ ill .

I &apos;m lo@@ ad@@ ed .
how did you meet him ?
I thought about you the other day .
he read@@ s French .
I slept n@@ ine hours .
no one tru@@ sts her .
why don &apos;t we talk about something else ?
the may@@ or ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ers the affai@@ rs of the city .
Tom is a timi@@ d young man .
she won@@ dered where S@@ am was and what he was doing .
we &apos;re on the same side .
things are only going to get worse .
nothing happened to Mary . she just forgot to call .
that is the thing that concer@@ n@@ s you .
the f@@ is@@ hing bo@@ at that had been mis@@ sing re@@ turned to its port saf@@ ely .
I want to stay in the house .
are you afraid of death ?
tomorrow will be even war@@ mer than today .
we eat so we may live .
when is good for you ?
my father was s@@ ad for the whole day as he had lost his w@@ all@@ et .
I don &apos;t care how much you say you love me . I know your feelings for her haven &apos;t changed .
he left home early in the morning so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble .
what the fuck is going on here ?
the o@@ st@@ rich has win@@ gs , but it cannot f@@ ly .
I was a bit dis@@ appointed .
I lost your phone number .
a ro@@ pe was th@@ ro@@ wn into the water .
it being Sun@@ day , the shop was closed .
J@@ e@@ an and K@@ ate are tw@@ ins .
who did this ?
how many children do you have ?
it wouldn &apos;t surprise me .
are you seri@@ ously thinking about not going ?
he told the bo@@ ss some co@@ ck@@ am@@ am@@ ie story about being sick and nee@@ ding days off from work .
read it to me .
is that all you can talk about - the Internet ?
I &apos;ll call you back later .
he was cho@@ s@@ en cap@@ tain .
thank you very much .

he is fon@@ d of pain@@ ting .
P@@ o@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans never tell us their in@@ ner th@@ ou@@ ghts .
I don &apos;t know who she is .
I &apos;ve got work to do here .
I &apos;ve enjo@@ yed talking to you .
her job is to type .
Tom was ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted .
you can &apos;t dance , can you ?
I accep@@ t your apo@@ log@@ y .
should I be talking to Tom ?
I need to know where you are .
what did I say yesterday ?
he speaks as if he were an exper@@ t .
we have a good team and everyone knows it .
I &apos;m watching the market clo@@ sel@@ y .
I have no imagin@@ ation .

your cri@@ ti@@ cis@@ m is un@@ fai@@ r .
I sp@@ ent the whole day reading a nov@@ el .
do Mar@@ ti@@ ans speak English ?
I &apos;m getting sleep@@ y . I should &apos;ve gone to bed ear@@ li@@ er last night .
we pic@@ ked flowers together .
it &apos;s no trouble at all .
I liked working with you .
G@@ o@@ o@@ d@@ night .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
he re@@ j@@ ected our off@@ er .
Tom found a job as a me@@ chan@@ ic .
I &apos;ll have a n@@ ap after lunch .
if he as@@ ks me that question , I won &apos;t answer .
I &apos;m not good @-@ looking .
were you aw@@ ake at 2 : 30 last night ?
why don &apos;t you stay a while ?
he ran to his mother in the library .
some water , please .
would you please s@@ low down ?
there &apos;s room inside .
Tom was reading a book while list@@ ening to music .
Tom needed your help .
we &apos;re all in this together .
may I try it on ?
close your eyes and tell me what you hear .
how does Tom plan to help ?
he &apos;s ad@@ dic@@ ted to j@@ unk food .
you &apos;re all alone .
they appro@@ ve .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
I can drive to Boston and back on one t@@ ank of g@@ as .
why don &apos;t you pu@@ ll over ?
why don &apos;t you meet me out front in a few minutes ?
Sami feel@@ s so scar@@ ed .
it is necessary for you to stop smoking .
I &apos;ve never come acro@@ ss such a strange case .
the company has hard and fast ru@@ les against l@@ at@@ en@@ ess .
you go@@ tt@@ a get more organ@@ i@@ zed .
she &apos;s a yo@@ g@@ a instruc@@ tor .
nobody ever laugh@@ s at my jo@@ kes .
it &apos;s hard to do that .
once a teacher , always a teacher .
Tom was playing go@@ l@@ f that morning .
does your dog bi@@ te ?
I just wanted to see what would happen .
brea@@ the , d@@ am@@ n you !
what he said made us angry .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
I &apos;m not your serv@@ ant .
I don &apos;t know whether to c@@ ry or to l@@ au@@ gh .
how come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
what did you do with that ?
A@@ d@@ ding up num@@ b@@ ers is very up@@ li@@ f@@ ting .
can I make copi@@ es ?
you won &apos;t die today .
I hi@@ d it somewhere .
Sami has been sick .
are you still up@@ set about what happened ?
she used mar@@ gar@@ ine inst@@ ead of but@@ ter .
I &apos;ll drive you somewhere .
Tom is ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate .
we have to learn all the son@@ gs before the end of the week .
would you like to visit the city ?
this gu@@ y &apos;s great at p@@ it@@ ching cur@@ ve@@ b@@ all@@ s .
one weekend all of the ho@@ tel@@ s in the city were full because there was a large con@@ ven@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t see Tom yesterday .
we still have a few wee@@ ks left .
she got all flu@@ st@@ ered when the boy she likes came over to talk to her .
there &apos;s less of it , but no less to it .
that hat be@@ comes you .
how long does it take to walk from here to the city h@@ all ?
he dre@@ am@@ ed about his home .
they have a ten @-@ year @-@ old son .
he was leaving then .
I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the l@@ at@@ est .
I don &apos;t think they al@@ low that .
come again ?
I saw the cake you made .
Tom and Mary have decided to get married in O@@ c@@ to@@ ber .
where are your friends going ?
as the door sli@@ d open , he almost fell on@@ to the pl@@ at@@ for@@ m .
can you use a computer ?
that &apos;s a lot of cas@@ h .
he &apos;s not a bad person .
if I tell him the truth , she will never for@@ give me .
you should have seen her .
some day we &apos;ll take a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
what time do you want me to pic@@ k you up ?
you got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t walk anymore .
I@@ ran is not I@@ ra@@ q .
his de@@ b@@ ts am@@ oun@@ t to two milli@@ on dollars .
Tom &apos;s eyes were full of tears .
what is today &apos;s date ?
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed you so much , Tom .
should I tell him that I like him or that I love him ?
I have nothing to f@@ ear .
I just in@@ v@@ ented a new word @-@ pro@@ c@@ es@@ so@@ r en@@ ab@@ ling to pron@@ oun@@ ce them b@@ ack@@ war@@ ds .
the old man started to l@@ au@@ gh s@@ ad@@ ly .
I &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
who will correct my mist@@ akes ?
do you think it was easy for me ?
I s@@ cre@@ am@@ ed but nobody could hear me .
can anyone drive ?
I am very ill at ea@@ se with str@@ ang@@ ers .
do you want me to tell Tom that we won &apos;t do that ?
two wee@@ ks have pass@@ ed and I haven &apos;t seen you .
don &apos;t look !
why don &apos;t you love me ?
Tom wants to buy a b@@ ass gu@@ it@@ ar , but he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I know you see it , but are you really looking at it ?
I cannot put up with her be@@ hav@@ i@@ or .
any of you can do it .
I remember what I saw .
they ad@@ m@@ itted that they &apos;d li@@ ed .
I don &apos;t like swimming in po@@ o@@ ls .
can you understand the me@@ an@@ ing of this sentence ?
the man was hi@@ ding in a den@@ se for@@ est .
I know that this is we@@ ir@@ d .
that would make sense .
no one had seen anything .
I have no si@@ bl@@ ings .
what &apos;s the go@@ l@@ d@@ en ru@@ le ?
he can har@@ dly speak any English .
I had my watch m@@ end@@ ed .
we can help you .
are you invol@@ ved in poli@@ ti@@ cs ?
b@@ low out the cand@@ les .
I wasn &apos;t enti@@ r@@ ely sure myself .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
it was a beautiful night .
I think you made the right choice .
the truth is I told a lie .
Tom has the experience necessary .
how do you stop this ?
you have too many ir@@ ons in the fire .
but it &apos;s me who should thank you .
he came while I was still as@@ le@@ ep .
I took over the bus@@ iness from F@@ a@@ ther .
o@@ il is expensive .
where did Tom buy it ?
I bought a house .
do you know who we are ?
it &apos;s as old as the world .
Dan ann@@ oun@@ ced that he and Lin@@ da were getting div@@ or@@ ced .
I have a vis@@ a .
it will be a great plea@@ sure for me to trans@@ late the story and to read it to you .
what &apos;s with the lu@@ gg@@ age ?
something is asked of me .
it &apos;s like being a k@@ id in a cand@@ y store .
M@@ ath@@ s is a good sub@@ ject .
you really speak French well .
for exam@@ ple , more people are cho@@ o@@ sing to live together and have children without getting married .
are you seri@@ ously thinking about going ?
it was a plea@@ sure meeting you , Tom .
if you don &apos;t eat , you &apos;ll die .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t have the right e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment .
I ran outside and the door lo@@ cked it@@ self behind me .
it would be coun@@ ter @-@ produc@@ tive to do such a thing .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m waiting im@@ pati@@ ently .
S@@ p@@ in@@ o@@ z@@ a was a p@@ an@@ the@@ ist .
I like both science and mat@@ h .
we &apos;re not certain of that yet .
I know it &apos;s not impossible .
I work in the morning .
Tom has re@@ ques@@ ted my as@@ sist@@ ance .
do you want to get us both killed ?
they all speak French .
why are you so good at ex@@ plain@@ ing things ?
no one will stop me .
I &apos;m a tr@@ ai@@ ne@@ e .
how much are you being p@@ aid to do this ?
she was loved by everybody in the village .
where do you train your students ?
have you seen my cam@@ era ?
I hear you were gr@@ oun@@ ded .
this book is too large to go in my po@@ cket .
could you please over@@ look it this time ?
when I was your age , I had a boy@@ friend .
I hate that gu@@ y .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
he bor@@ ro@@ wed the car from his friend .
this TV was made in Ch@@ ina .
I feel sick every morning .
you should know yourself .
he took this photo .
would you like to read this magazine ?
he took charge of the fir@@ m after his father &apos;s death .
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French .
I f@@ illed up the vase with water .
it doesn &apos;t matter who s@@ ays that , it &apos;s not true .
this is how I made it .
do you know how to play ch@@ ess ?
this bicycle is mine . yours is over there .
it &apos;s an em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y !
for me , the real world is just a fic@@ tion .
speaking of fil@@ ms , why not go to the cin@@ em@@ a tonight ?
Tom felt his phone vi@@ br@@ ate .
will it be fine tomorrow ?
I never really gave it much thought .
Tom likes living in Boston .
anything you want , my d@@ ear .
she attr@@ ac@@ ted me at first sight .
that is the fun@@ ni@@ est jo@@ ke that I have ever heard .
he promis@@ ed to pro@@ vide information .
I &apos;m taking care of it . you can rel@@ a@@ x . you can r@@ ely on me .
are you still sick ?
I &apos;ve just spoken to your French teacher and he s@@ ays you &apos;re doing well in his class .
everybody &apos;s in a hurry these days .
she likes to go to the library .
everyone is waiting in the other room .
it mat@@ ters to me .
the cold air re@@ vi@@ v@@ ed Tom .
are you out of your mind ?
she temp@@ ted him .
everyone can make a differ@@ ence in their own lives and ther@@ e@@ by coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ ely make the world a better place for th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves and others around them .
you &apos;re not in a hurry , are you ?
let &apos;s come back to it later .
I should talk to Tom .
you &apos;d better stay with me .
once u@@ po@@ n a time there lived an em@@ per@@ or who was a great con@@ qu@@ er@@ or , and re@@ ig@@ ned over more coun@@ tri@@ es than anyone in the world .
can you come to the party ?
don &apos;t s@@ pl@@ as@@ h me !
Tom har@@ dly spoke any French when I first met him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my trip .
there &apos;s only one pretty child in the world , and every mother has it .
J@@ ac@@ ques made it clear that he wanted to meet Mr G@@ ag@@ n@@ on .
everyone is free to contribu@@ te .
Tom was mu@@ gg@@ ed on his way home from work .
they made sure nobody could see them .
a gu@@ y ne@@ ar@@ ly ran into us .
I think we have some un@@ finished bus@@ iness .
I &apos;ve lost my f@@ ill@@ ing .
do you think that &apos;s true ?
if you would be a good read@@ er , read ; if a wri@@ ter , write .
I hate those spi@@ der@@ s . they &apos;re always there to fre@@ a@@ k me out when I &apos;m cle@@ an@@ ing .
no such person ex@@ i@@ sts .
do your best !
I gave up hope .
she advised him to cut down on smoking .
no matter how much I think about it , I can &apos;t understand it .
she told him a jo@@ ke .
can you put the children to bed ?
Marie &apos;s hi@@ ding something from me .
did you go to Tom &apos;s party last S@@ at@@ ur@@ day ?
he wrote a nov@@ el bas@@ ed on anci@@ ent my@@ ths .
Tom went rock cli@@ m@@ b@@ ing .
she didn &apos;t like this game .
they &apos;ve known each other for a very long time .
don &apos;t touch this !
you &apos;ve been war@@ ned .
he plays the piano very well .
what makes you so sure Tom was the one who sto@@ le your bicycle ?
she has good ide@@ as .
what a horri@@ ble thing !
we have no choice but to give up the whole plan .
you &apos;re a tr@@ ai@@ tor .
we take ris@@ ks all the time .
Z@@ ai@@ l@@ ai@@ b@@ a b@@ ar is hi@@ ring wai@@ ters ; are you interested ?
I can &apos;t li@@ ft my right ar@@ m .
I tried fl@@ ying from the top of the tree .
this pri@@ est is a good man .
I sometimes lie on the gr@@ ass .
Tom thought Mary was safe .
I just want to know why you br@@ ought me here .
open the door .
it &apos;s almost hard to believe all these beautiful things were made by hand such a long time ago .
we as@@ su@@ me that he is hon@@ est .
are you all right ?
wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever road you may take , it will l@@ ead to the station .
if I were you , I &apos;d buy that one .
he makes himself acc@@ es@@ sible to all who see@@ k his coun@@ se@@ l .
I &apos;m sorry I mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood you .
where can I find a taxi ?
she &apos;s going through a mi@@ d@@ life cri@@ s@@ is .
the res@@ cu@@ ed re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es were lon@@ g@@ ing for fre@@ e@@ d@@ om .
stop suc@@ king up to the teacher .
re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly s@@ lam@@ ming the clu@@ t@@ ch pe@@ d@@ al , I some@@ how man@@ ag@@ ed to get the clu@@ t@@ ch dis@@ en@@ gag@@ ed so I could just about drive for the time being .
they did not believe me .
we know you &apos;re interested .
the house is bur@@ ning !
we consider Tom hon@@ est .
I &apos;ll give you a simple exam@@ ple .
win@@ ds from the sea are mo@@ ist .
we have arrived safe and sound .
we are going to leave tomorrow .
Mr W@@ il@@ son is prou@@ d of his house .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
the meeting will be hel@@ d regar@@ d@@ less of the weather .
in the Ar@@ c@@ tic there are no pen@@ gu@@ ins .
she &apos;s young , n@@ ai@@ ve and in@@ experi@@ enc@@ ed .
