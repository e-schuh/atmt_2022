today is a new day !
I want you to get started right away .
do you see the six windo@@ ws on the fac@@ ade ?
one should be respec@@ t@@ ful of other &apos;s beli@@ e@@ fs rather than mo@@ ck them .
people usually die if you kill them .
it was working .
Tom needs us to show him the way .
just do your job .
the train was about to leave the station .
here is an at@@ om@@ ic po@@ wer pl@@ ant .
when the al@@ ar@@ m clock goes off , I don &apos;t mo@@ ve .
this feel@@ s like sil@@ k .
a traffic accident happened there .
Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence , fore@@ ver , dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed our Mary .
we im@@ port coffee from B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
but you cannot understand . how could you understand what it is to feel old ?
why do I believe you ?
you sp@@ read your affai@@ rs too th@@ in .
those box spea@@ k@@ ers have a good re@@ ver@@ b .
they were h@@ ang@@ ing on her words .
inst@@ ead of compl@@ ain@@ ing , maybe you should help .
I think we can hand@@ le that .
I am de@@ e@@ ply interested in art .

I never me@@ ant for any of this to happen .
the de@@ er was running by it@@ self .
for him , div@@ or@@ ce is a good in@@ ven@@ tion , with one so@@ le dis@@ adv@@ antage : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an comm@@ is@@ sion &apos;s re@@ comm@@ end@@ ations were igno@@ red .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .

she in@@ tend@@ ed to become an ac@@ tr@@ ess .
he is always ex@@ pres@@ si@@ on@@ less .

bl@@ ame it on the weather .
I can ex@@ plain it to you , but I can &apos;t understand it for you !
sh@@ ame on you for your dis@@ courag@@ ement !
he left the room without saying a word .
I &apos;d like to get medic@@ al in@@ surance .
he went down the h@@ ill .
the girls gi@@ g@@ gl@@ ed .
is anybody there ?
I &apos;m not scar@@ ed of women .
the angry mo@@ b over@@ turned car@@ s and sm@@ as@@ hed sto@@ re@@ front windo@@ ws .
I res@@ ig@@ n .
I know he is busy .
the man and his hor@@ se that fell off the cli@@ f@@ f were soon res@@ cu@@ ed .
she is very c@@ un@@ ning .
it was a com@@ promise .
he is ap@@ t to forget .
a bir@@ d in the hand is better than two in the bus@@ h .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
turn right at the next inter@@ sec@@ tion .
you look busy .
they all laugh@@ ed at their er@@ ro@@ r .
Tom didn &apos;t eat the app@@ le you gave him .
bir@@ ds have n@@ es@@ ts , spi@@ der@@ s have we@@ b@@ s , and hum@@ ans have fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p .
ten years have gone by .
I &apos;m tr@@ app@@ ed .

I left behind some important do@@ cu@@ ments for the company at home . sorry , but could you please go and get them for me now ?
&quot; listen to me , &quot; said the D@@ em@@ on , plac@@ ing his hand u@@ po@@ n my head .
you should have stop@@ ped .
he spr@@ ain@@ ed his an@@ k@@ le .
Tom looks older than he really is .
I was watching the s@@ cen@@ e ho@@ l@@ ding my bre@@ ath .
Mary got to know her boy@@ friend in Paris .

she turned a p@@ age of her book .
yes , you should wear red li@@ p@@ sti@@ ck for V@@ al@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day .
Tom isn &apos;t invited to parti@@ es often .
you see the words that I ty@@ ped on the s@@ cre@@ en , but you don &apos;t see the tears that I sh@@ ed over the key@@ bo@@ ard .
give me a ti@@ p .
what do you want to drink with your m@@ eal ?

the windo@@ ws were open .
Tom wanted to go home early .
I forgot my de@@ bit card at home .
you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Mary thre@@ w a po@@ ta@@ to through the window .
everyone des@@ er@@ ves a second chance .
I find that it &apos;s best to find a happy bal@@ ance between orig@@ in@@ ality and sti@@ c@@ king to a stri@@ c@@ t stand@@ ard .
I remember meeting her somewhere .
I &apos;m br@@ in@@ ging home a pi@@ zz@@ a .
here is where it all happen@@ s .
soon your efforts will be re@@ war@@ ded .
is the coffee hot ?
th@@ anks for jo@@ in@@ ing us .
it &apos;s a p@@ ity that you can &apos;t travel with us .
I wonder what happened to P@@ au@@ l .
you know where to find me if you need anything .
no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s b@@ lowing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we talked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .
don &apos;t you feel stupid now ?
Tom &apos;s phone can take pic@@ tures .
what do you want the message to be ?
m@@ om said I caught a cold because I went out with w@@ et hair .
how many more for@@ ks do you need ?
rar@@ ely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ eful d@@ anc@@ er .
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed another chance .
I don &apos;t know how to cont@@ act you .
do you want to join me for lunch ?
all of these let@@ ters are ad@@ dres@@ sed to you .
Tom knew where he had put his keys .
you could coun@@ t to ten when you were two .
I just found it .
Tom is laugh@@ ing .
do you know what day it is today ?
the poor cat was run over by a tru@@ ck .
I don &apos;t want to get invol@@ ved in that bus@@ iness .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed .
the boy was cl@@ ever enough to solve the pu@@ zz@@ le .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .
I appreciate your work .
the sy@@ ste@@ m is ri@@ gg@@ ed .
an arti@@ st must have an eye for col@@ our .
Oh wo@@ w ! what &apos;s this , you &apos;re having lunch without me !
you sound tired .
maybe Tom is in love .
look at the met@@ er .
Thomas changed into pro@@ per clo@@ thing .
my mother bought two bo@@ tt@@ les of or@@ ange ju@@ ice .
taking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation , the res@@ ul@@ t is better than I exp@@ ected .
I guess right n@@ ine times out of ten .
that &apos;s a nice p@@ air of legs .
it is by this reason that he left school .
&quot; have you finished ? &quot; &quot; on the contr@@ ary . I haven &apos;t even started . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t like be@@ ef . nei@@ ther do I .
where did you go to school ?

I tell you a little secret .
I &apos;m not scar@@ ed at all .
he was ac@@ comp@@ an@@ i@@ ed by his girlfriend .

can you wash my je@@ ans ?
do you speak M@@ al@@ t@@ ese ?
I &apos;m as curi@@ ous as you are .
Oh , how we laugh@@ ed !
what &apos;s your occup@@ ation ?
that picture does not do jus@@ tice to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is wi@@ se who nei@@ ther ho@@ pes no@@ r fe@@ ars anything from the un@@ certain future .
our class has tw@@ enty @-@ five boys and tw@@ enty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
once I reti@@ re , I will de@@ dic@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba .

what does your father like ?
what a cat@@ as@@ tr@@ op@@ he !
for the sh@@ ar@@ ks , we saw them , not by un@@ its , no@@ r by ten@@ s , no@@ r by hun@@ dre@@ ds ; but by th@@ ous@@ and@@ s and by my@@ ri@@ ad@@ s . trust me , there are more sh@@ ar@@ ks in the sea than mor@@ tal@@ s on land .
you should get up early .
love is terri@@ fied of everything that is not it@@ self .
he &apos;ll be back in ten .
if I wanted to s@@ care you , I would have told you about what I dre@@ am@@ t about a few wee@@ ks ago .
you &apos;re not dead yet .
I know a good restaurant that &apos;s in@@ expensive .
who is the person in charge ?
trying to find happ@@ iness only makes you un@@ happy .
I want to speak to a la@@ w@@ yer .
he av@@ eng@@ ed his dead father .
she liked that .
I &apos;m so@@ re all over .
why don &apos;t you sit down ?
stop sho@@ wing off !
the weather is very cold in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l .
I &apos;m doing you a fav@@ or .
you were afraid , weren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like the t@@ as@@ te of on@@ ions .

when do you mean to start ?
why do the stars tw@@ in@@ k@@ le ?
when I came home , he was watching TV .
she n@@ am@@ ed him Ch@@ ar@@ les .
she san@@ g better than him .
I made a propos@@ al .
what do you plan on doing tonight ?
I &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t do that .
there is milk in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ or .
I don &apos;t know her address .
I don &apos;t bl@@ ame you for doing that .
I have a friend who lives in K@@ yo@@ to .

Mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stand@@ ings do occu@@ r .
are you going to be OK ?

what was the co@@ lo@@ r of the app@@ le he gave you ?
they surviv@@ ed , even th@@ ough the building was des@@ tro@@ yed .

my heart was pou@@ n@@ ding as my turn got ne@@ ar@@ er .
that &apos;s not fai@@ r ! you saw my car@@ ds in the mi@@ r@@ ro@@ r !
she was so beautiful that the mer@@ ch@@ ant &apos;s son could not help k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to kiss her hand .

get back to where you started .
that is of no use to me .
get me all the information you can on this matter .
I went to Boston by train .
maybe Tom should pay more attention in class .
you were sleeping , weren &apos;t you ?
there are no dr@@ u@@ gs here .

let@@ ters are d@@ eli@@ ver@@ ed every day .
