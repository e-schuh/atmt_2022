stop y@@ el@@ ling .
there are only 10 minutes left until the end of the les@@ son .
Sami has a ride .
she doesn &apos;t want him to pic@@ k the flowers .
I want you to remember this moment .
there used to be a store right here .
two small bo@@ tt@@ les , please .
I knew you had a boy@@ friend !
there is an ur@@ gent need for the lo@@ cal go@@ vernment to help the hom@@ el@@ ess .

there is nothing left to eat .
I can &apos;t stand being tre@@ ated like a child .

I wanted to speak to you about this .
have you anything to dec@@ l@@ are ?
he has no bicycle .
are you saying I have no sense of hu@@ mo@@ r ?
today is not so cold .
women have beau@@ ty , but do books not also have beau@@ ty ?
where was your father ?
the inter@@ n is l@@ azy .
I have a little something for you .
I like to in@@ vent us@@ eful things .
students study in school .
anyone who is not sho@@ cked by qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m theory has not understood it .
we would have hel@@ ped them .
my TV is broken .
we have enough .
I got into a fi@@ ght .
it is a super idea .

Sami &apos;s plan@@ e hasn &apos;t even taken off .

if it &apos;s that hot , how about you take off all your clothes ?
I don &apos;t have a ticket .
she is my mother @-@ in @-@ la@@ w .
Tom wasn &apos;t wearing shoes .
bring me a cup of coffee , please .
so , what else is going on ?
you will find the restaurant on your right .
is Tom still playing ?
two th@@ ous@@ and people fit into this h@@ all .
he has this large room to himself .
don &apos;t you ever come here again !
I got into trouble with the police by driving too fast .

in the cen@@ ter of the univers@@ ity cam@@ p@@ us stand@@ s the stat@@ ue of the f@@ oun@@ der .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
I know who he is .

I wonder why I didn &apos;t think of that .
we expect heavy res@@ ist@@ ance .
I &apos;ll try to pay this bill tomorrow .
Tom left everything to Mary in his will .
I &apos;m not as smart as you .

pri@@ ces are high .
would you be friends with me ?
I can &apos;t go out because I have a lot of hom@@ e@@ work .
if you get bit by a r@@ ab@@ id dog , you &apos;ll need a t@@ et@@ an@@ us shot .
I &apos;m not ready for this .
I agree with what you say to some ex@@ tent .
he put the key in the lo@@ ck .
this time , you &apos;ve gone too far .
they were not im@@ press@@ ed .
I &apos;ve never vo@@ ted .
let me hand@@ le it .
how much rent do you pay for the a@@ part@@ ment ?
I can har@@ dly brea@@ the .

is there a student dis@@ coun@@ t ?
I hope you have in@@ surance .

tea@@ ching is learning .
I close my eyes , but I &apos;m sem@@ i @-@ aw@@ ake .

OK , very good .
you should stay in the hospital for tre@@ at@@ ment .
could you please tell me again who your father is ?
do you have a b@@ ack@@ up plan ?
everyone started laugh@@ ing .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
I even wrote a letter to her .
what &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
we have way too much work to do .
he is de@@ e@@ ply att@@ ach@@ ed to her .
he is not such a n@@ as@@ ty fel@@ low as you think .

we have come a long way .
this is my fav@@ ou@@ rite sub@@ ject .
how many languages are spoken wor@@ l@@ d@@ wi@@ de ?

I &apos;ve got a br@@ and new bike .
Tom knew what Mary had done .
he is h@@ ated by all .
I don &apos;t bi@@ te .
this will only take a second .
Tom and Mary are living in France since yesterday .
we lost .
he went into re@@ h@@ a@@ b .
we must think about these pl@@ ans in ter@@ ms of what they would cost .
he &apos;s feeling much better .
Tom sin@@ gs in a ch@@ ur@@ ch cho@@ ir .
he felt un@@ easy in his father &apos;s pres@@ ence .
am I the only one who didn &apos;t understand what was going on ?
the st@@ or@@ m did great d@@ am@@ age to her pro@@ per@@ ty .
I &apos;m sorry for the pain I caus@@ ed you and your family .
I lost my wife in a traffic accident .
nothing has gone right all day .
make has@@ te .
you &apos;re very timi@@ d .
we &apos;re all in this together .
he dro@@ pped the an@@ cho@@ vies .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
do you mind if we come in ?
it &apos;s very cold , this winter !
this is bad .
as far as I am concer@@ ned , I am not against your opinion .
he sel@@ d@@ om or@@ der@@ s anything new .
I quite co@@ tt@@ oned on to that man .
he came running .
he is not himself today .
it &apos;s not going to be easy to finish this job on time .
this is going to happen a lot from now on .
this o@@ il well has been suc@@ ked d@@ ry .

Dan dr@@ ag@@ g@@ ed Lin@@ da out of the house and thre@@ w her in the stre@@ et .

Tom des@@ er@@ ves pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment .
what do you think happened to Tom ?
it &apos;s like being in a cand@@ y store .
this evening we will go to ch@@ ur@@ ch .
it &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
there were a lot of girls at the party .
come to help me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was afraid of g@@ ho@@ sts .
he is well @-@ liked .
I ad@@ ded his name to the li@@ st .
thank you for your efforts .
I need to see you in my office .
the co@@ sts are too high .
I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place .
don &apos;t m@@ ess with me !
I feel very str@@ on@@ g@@ ly about that .
she ow@@ es me money .
can you leave me alone ?
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t happy here .
this little girl lives in B@@ ra@@ z@@ il .
I feel like someone just walked over my gr@@ ave .
give me chap@@ ter and verse .
can you come over and talk ?
I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that .
our gard@@ en produ@@ ced an ab@@ un@@ dance of c@@ ab@@ b@@ ages last year .
why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Tom didn &apos;t show up for work yesterday .
I must find out who is behind this .
I thought you &apos;d want to meet my family .
I can &apos;t stand this hot weather .
give us the det@@ ails .
she w@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ed him being killed .
I &apos;ll never give up .
I was tr@@ app@@ ed in a vi@@ ci@@ ous cir@@ cle .
Mary &apos;s sister knew all about Tom &apos;s secrets .
you should be more careful the next time .
Tom makes a lot of mist@@ akes .
it will be ready soon .
there &apos;s a com@@ par@@ ati@@ v@@ ely large cin@@ em@@ a comple@@ x inside the m@@ all .
who &apos;s hi@@ ding behind the cur@@ tain ?
ob@@ vi@@ ously , you vo@@ lun@@ te@@ ered .
see life in ter@@ ms of po@@ wer .
the weather is good .
do you really want to win ?
most of them urg@@ ed him to take the job .
Sami came to give Layla her gi@@ ft .
nothing was fun@@ ny .
I never loved you .
let &apos;s talk man to man .
I can &apos;t do that with you because I don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom is bor@@ ing , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
we are living through a bi@@ o@@ di@@ vers@@ ity cri@@ s@@ is .
I know something &apos;s wrong .
I just don &apos;t want to go with you .
really ? I didn &apos;t know she was your sister .
he &apos;s working at his English .
they live on the floor b@@ en@@ e@@ ath .
there is a pon@@ d in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the park .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be right back .
she speaks too much .
no taxi stop@@ ped .
you must not stop on the hard sh@@ oul@@ der to go to the toil@@ et .
something is wrong with the eng@@ ine of this car .
I was surprised by the news this morning .
Tom gets up@@ set easily .
this man is a le@@ g@@ end .
enjoy your m@@ eal ! did you already start ?
you &apos;re a s@@ no@@ b .
I figured I could coun@@ t on you .
we &apos;d like another bo@@ ttle of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner ser@@ ved ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always for@@ getting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the price is reas@@ on@@ able .
In@@ du@@ stri@@ es in@@ cre@@ as@@ in@@ g@@ ly became g@@ ear@@ ed for ou@@ ter space .
she likes no one and no one likes her .
just pre@@ ten@@ d you don &apos;t know me .
the name of my country is written without any article .
the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alis@@ ed world is used to using water prof@@ li@@ g@@ ately .
thank you for your det@@ ai@@ led ex@@ plan@@ ation .
you &apos;re my her@@ o , Sami .
my legs are wea@@ k .
she doesn &apos;t know the ti@@ t@@ le of the book you &apos;re talking about .
let &apos;s talk shop for a while .
she pou@@ red the milk into a bo@@ w@@ l .
run hot water into the bat@@ h .
she tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .
may I have your order , please ?
the radio is a bit lou@@ d .
Mary is a yo@@ del@@ er .
he kept on laugh@@ ing at me .
I could tell you about be@@ e@@ kee@@ ping for hours , but I don &apos;t want to bo@@ re you .
don &apos;t all speak at once .
it was very cold .
I &apos;m getting tired of looking at fu@@ r@@ n@@ itu@@ re we can &apos;t aff@@ or@@ d .
he wants you to come home .
you &apos;re early .
I found the em@@ p@@ ty box .
she made him rich .
he was standing at the top of the mountain .
she le@@ an@@ ed to@@ war@@ ds me .
this is what I wanted .
you re@@ mind me of myself when I was your age .
these pi@@ ec@@ es of fu@@ r@@ n@@ itu@@ re are not for sa@@ le .
I love what you &apos;ve done to this place .
I am learning German .
please close the door behind you .
have you made a li@@ st yet ?
without o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en , all anim@@ als would have dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ed long ago .
why &apos;s Tom still here ?
we need money .
it &apos;s my faul@@ t , not yours .
no one is am@@ used .
I wonder why you would like so much to learn English .
while we were having te@@ a , there was an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake .
either they don &apos;t want to or they can &apos;t .
what is in your hands ?
we need you .
I &apos;ll just leave .
I went to the market .
it was one of the most re@@ war@@ ding experi@@ ences of my life .
he is respon@@ sible for the accident .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re consi@@ der@@ ing doing that .
I can think of s@@ ever@@ al reas@@ ons .
you might get hurt .
you &apos;re the only one who can help .
when was the last time you talked to Tom ?
do you really think Tom is happy ?
you &apos;ve been in@@ f@@ ected .
there were six sh@@ ee@@ p in the fi@@ el@@ d .
are you thinking about getting a job ?
I &apos;m still not sure .
if you fe@@ ed your dog pro@@ per@@ ly , you can in@@ cre@@ ase his li@@ f@@ esp@@ an .
the stre@@ et in front of my house is pretty n@@ ar@@ row .
when are we going to leave ?
my br@@ ain is fri@@ ed .
a new road is under con@@ struc@@ tion .
Tom had a little accident .
they kept drin@@ king .
did you read it enti@@ r@@ ely ?
she &apos;s two years youn@@ ger than him .
our teacher often over@@ looked his name on the li@@ st .
Tom still ow@@ es me a lot of money .
get the h@@ ell out my way !
be careful !
the population of Japan is lar@@ ger than that of New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and .
I &apos;d prefer not to eat that .
the price ro@@ se .
the pain has l@@ ess@@ en@@ ed a little .
I wish I could ex@@ plain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my keys ?
that &apos;s terrible advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s absolu@@ te n@@ on@@ sense !
the teacher pun@@ ished her students for using bad words .
how can you ac@@ cuse me of such a thing ? I would never l@@ ay a hand on my child .
Tom is thir@@ st@@ y .
he has a S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n acc@@ ent .
don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
the problem is the@@ irs .
in times of cri@@ s@@ is one should never ide@@ ali@@ se the past .
you can &apos;t sit there .
I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my umbrella in the c@@ a@@ b .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s cous@@ in .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .
no one has ever seen God .
some tea@@ ch@@ ers have a great eff@@ ect on their students .
we &apos;re old friends .
we avo@@ id talking about poli@@ ti@@ cs .
I am not av@@ ai@@ l@@ able .
do you believe in Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity ?
none of these car@@ s are mine .
please mai@@ l this letter on your next trip to the post office .
you still have a lot to learn .
I want to get back .
I &apos;m sorry that I couldn &apos;t live up to your exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ations .
you can go if you want to .
I am con@@ vin@@ ced that he is innocent .
do all of you speak French ?
is this wine from Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ina ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom and Mary are waiting for .
there &apos;s no w@@ ind today .
there were no fen@@ ces on the great pl@@ ains .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I think it would have been a better sho@@ ot with a 1@@ 0@@ m@@ m l@@ ens .
geni@@ us is only one re@@ mo@@ ve from in@@ san@@ ity .
I &apos;m going to show you the photo .
get rich !
everything is going fine .
you may cho@@ ose any book you like .
girl as she was , J@@ o@@ an was not d@@ au@@ n@@ ted at all .
I have a rough idea what needs to be done .
you can ad@@ d whatever to@@ p@@ p@@ ings you like to the pi@@ zz@@ a .
I had never seen such a sh@@ in@@ y st@@ ar .
I want your name and b@@ ad@@ ge number .
could I have the bill , please ?
he is too drunk to drive home .
experience is the best teacher .
Tom was on TV yesterday .
pain@@ ting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
how did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
food is necessary for life .
that s@@ ounds good !
we char@@ tered a bus .
ask me again some other time .
I don &apos;t want to up@@ set you .
I can &apos;t wait .
rec@@ ently the number of car@@ s has great@@ ly in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed .
you &apos;ve om@@ itted the pre@@ position in this sentence .
enjoy yourself to the fu@@ ll@@ est .
Tom told me that he h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live .
don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bo@@ red . let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom in@@ tend@@ ed to do that .
the fir@@ m has its head office in O@@ sa@@ k@@ a .
today , I was with a friend at the swimming po@@ ol .
Tom put some o@@ at milk in his coffee .
I made him sw@@ ee@@ p the floor .
I don &apos;t have those answ@@ ers .
my daughter likes to play with doll@@ s .
have you ever been there ?
are you through with your work ?
you can &apos;t just leave your car par@@ ked in front of the fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
I thought that you were going to wait for me .
can cats really see in the dark ?
one minute has si@@ x@@ ty secon@@ ds .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s changed .
I &apos;ve had a perf@@ ec@@ tly wonder@@ ful evening . but this wasn &apos;t it .
keep your gun hand@@ y .
my name is H@@ op@@ k@@ ins .
Tom wo@@ ke up with hear@@ t@@ bur@@ n .
he has written a letter .
why are you wor@@ ried ?
I don &apos;t remember mai@@ ling the letter .
is all of this money yours ?
in 19@@ 1@@ 2 , the A@@ u@@ stri@@ an tai@@ lo@@ r Fr@@ an@@ z R@@ ei@@ ch@@ el@@ t died ju@@ m@@ ping off the first floor of the E@@ i@@ ff@@ el T@@ o@@ wer while trying out his new in@@ ven@@ tion , the par@@ ach@@ u@@ te coat , which did not work ...
Tom has cho@@ s@@ en you .
I thought you were at work .
it was a very , very hot night .
everyone out !
why are you dr@@ ying your hair ?
she didn &apos;t show up .
you seem happy .
there was no sw@@ el@@ ling .
my dog sometimes e@@ ats gr@@ ass .
why are you so interested ?
no comment .
he is a g@@ ent@@ l@@ eman .
you &apos;re very timi@@ d .
I have a red home .
the teacher can see you .
nobody knows exactly how many rac@@ es make up the population of the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
the tre@@ es will soon be b@@ are .
I thought she was stupid .
I aw@@ o@@ ke to find everything had been a dre@@ am .
she knows herself well .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
do you eat ri@@ ce every day ?
har@@ dly had he en@@ tered the room , when she bur@@ st into tears .
I &apos;m not as afraid of he@@ i@@ ghts as I used to be .
you &apos;ll be safe with her .
how long does it take by car ?
can we get some help ?
you must take adv@@ antage of the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity .
I opened a bo@@ ttle of red wine .
you have a great imagin@@ ation .
she vo@@ lun@@ te@@ ered to go to the meeting with him .
she &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your pl@@ ate .
I ad@@ mit I was surprised .
when will you re@@ turn ?
you can &apos;t just come in here and start or@@ der@@ ing people around .
what is the use of ph@@ ilo@@ so@@ ph@@ y ?
I was us@@ her@@ ed to my se@@ at .
I had something plan@@ ned .
Tom has trav@@ el@@ ed around the world .
Tom never gave up .
I don &apos;t really want to have another child .
the n@@ un pr@@ ayed and cro@@ s@@ sed herself .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
she advised him where he should stay .
new blan@@ k@@ ets were dist@@ ribu@@ ted to the poor .
tell them what happened .
it did not come off .
I promise you I &apos;ll keep you safe .
it isn &apos;t expensive .
H@@ o@@ ly Tom !
here is a letter for you .
he &apos;s be@@ ating me , three to z@@ i@@ p .
they all en@@ tered .
the go@@ l@@ d@@ fish is ali@@ ve .
she urg@@ ed him to consider the requ@@ est .
it &apos;ll be easy to find someone to do that .
like it ?
you didn &apos;t let me answer .
G@@ re@@ et@@ ings , str@@ anger .
have you seen him before ?
the tree fell over in the ty@@ pho@@ on .
what kind of music does Tom like ?
this ticket is vali@@ d for three days .
I &apos;m innocent .
she wal@@ ks .
they came last week .
there are 10 ty@@ pes of people in the world : those who understand b@@ in@@ ary , and those who don &apos;t .
I was hi@@ dd@@ en .
we almost fro@@ ze to death .
I never felt com@@ fortable around your parents .
there was blood on Tom &apos;s shirt .
he is a po@@ et of a sort .
give me your address .
Tom and Mary were in love with each other .
S@@ and@@ ra has gro@@ wn up to be a beautiful woman .
I &apos;d sugg@@ est that you clean up a bit before your mother gets here .
here &apos;s where the fun beg@@ ins .
could you ad@@ d me ?
I suppose we have nothing to lose .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is invol@@ ved in a cri@@ me .
if your answer is correct , it fol@@ lo@@ ws that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ on in a fore@@ ig@@ n land .
we tried to che@@ er her up .
they bur@@ ned all the do@@ cu@@ ments .
you &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one believ@@ ed you .
the h@@ all was dec@@ or@@ ated with Japanese pain@@ t@@ ings .
if I were in your place , I would l@@ end him a hand .
nobody susp@@ ected anything .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
she made me hurry .
they ir@@ oned out their differ@@ ences .
these aren &apos;t my keys .
we are having lunch .
a gro@@ wing child requ@@ ires more food .
how long did they live in En@@ gl@@ and ?
how is your daughter ?
it &apos;s lunch time .
see what happen@@ s when you give people advice ?
it &apos;s time for us to get ready .
if he doesn &apos;t come , we won &apos;t go .
what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at least w@@ ill@@ ing to consider the possibili@@ ty of other al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves .
you don &apos;t have to come .
I can fin@@ ally see the light at the end of the t@@ un@@ nel .
I was completely dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated .
he turned his th@@ ou@@ ghts to@@ ward home .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
I asked Tom if he needed more money .
Tom knows that he can win .
I am very tired from the hard work .
I &apos;ve already told everybody to go home .
Tom never re@@ ach@@ ed Australi@@ a .
we should have set off ear@@ li@@ er .
I mean to go tomorrow if the weather is fine .
may comes after A@@ pri@@ l .
his death was a great lo@@ ss to our fir@@ m .
my older brother is an au@@ th@@ ori@@ ty on ph@@ ilo@@ so@@ ph@@ y .
everybody needs to cal@@ m down .
there &apos;s a great restaurant around the cor@@ ner .
children f@@ illed the room .
why wouldn &apos;t you let me tell you what happened ?
it &apos;s rain@@ ing cats and dogs .
it &apos;s an excuse .
I think so .
you look nervous .
I like being alone .
I have a few easy questions for you .
hurry up , girls .
do you think this j@@ el@@ ly &apos;s fir@@ m enough to eat yet ?
I was on a trip to In@@ di@@ a .
he was my mat@@ h teacher .
you &apos;re cr@@ af@@ ty .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between a vir@@ us and a b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia .
what do you want to talk to me about ?
the boy was se@@ ar@@ ching for the lost key .
sugar dis@@ sol@@ ves in water .
it felt pretty good .
do you have a table on the pati@@ o ?
you &apos;ll find this les@@ son easy .
believe me . I &apos;ll be a new man .
if only I could already speak German flu@@ ently !
I want you to have a job that you love .
are Tom and Mary sure ?
I still don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom was like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .
be on your gu@@ ard against pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets .
the girls are exc@@ ited .
what time &apos;s your train ?
he sp@@ un her around , took her in his ar@@ ms , di@@ pped her back , and gave her a big H@@ o@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od kiss .
Tom is usually very quiet , isn &apos;t he ?
why is au@@ tu@@ m@@ n called &quot; fall &quot; in Americ@@ a ?
in my opinion , he is correct .
I have enough money to buy it .
are there any ban@@ an@@ as ?
he is a scienti@@ st .
Tom wanted me to learn French .
the C@@ old W@@ ar end@@ ed when the S@@ o@@ vi@@ et Uni@@ on coll@@ ap@@ sed .
we have to do this .
your wish is a comm@@ and for me .
he would not take the money .

why can &apos;t I love them both ?
did you know &quot; cre@@ du@@ l@@ ous &quot; is not in the dictionary ?
I would like to learn to speak English with confi@@ d@@ ence .
I &apos;m a single child .

the her@@ oin isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m cel@@ e@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
whatever you do , don &apos;t s@@ mi@@ le .
it would be better for both of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could solve the pu@@ zz@@ le .
women are physi@@ c@@ ally wea@@ ker than men .
I feel like such an idiot .
what have you done today ?
I arrived on the night he left .
her feelings are easily hurt .
I know it was an accident .
there are many pi@@ ge@@ ons in the C@@ ity S@@ qu@@ are .

I knew you &apos;d know where to find Tom .
I &apos;m glad I learned English .
we can &apos;t do this again .
are you hurt ?

I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my favorite sub@@ ject in high school .
it would be better if you work this afternoon .
if for some reason that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami slept in his tent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expensive as I exp@@ ected it to be .
they appointed him as a direc@@ tor .
almost everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one large foot@@ prin@@ t and a couple of different si@@ ze sm@@ aller foot@@ prin@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sense ?
they were taken pri@@ son@@ er .
what is the t@@ all@@ est mountain in Europe ?
Tom lost his glasses somewhere in the gard@@ en .
he has been to France .

try to be more pun@@ ctu@@ al from now on .
when I run , I get sw@@ eat@@ y .
I have to go .
have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already f@@ illed out the for@@ m .
bring an umbrella without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d prefer to die rather than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she advised him to talk about his life in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be fine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any dou@@ b@@ ts , do you ?
Tom bur@@ st out laugh@@ ing .
I can not aff@@ or@@ d to buy a used car .
we caught him red @-@ hand@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for patience .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ plac@@ ement for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was hit by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same dec@@ ision I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
I have a large be@@ d@@ room .
let the cat out .
I fin@@ ally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of compl@@ ain@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ hav@@ es .
we &apos;re not invited .
you need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to dis@@ play only the l@@ ines with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; inside .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball near the windo@@ ws .
the Earth is like a ball with a large mag@@ n@@ et inside .
that &apos;s just what I needed .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want fu@@ r@@ ther information .
I could har@@ dly end@@ ure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful but@@ ter@@ f@@ ly .
French was the language of diplom@@ ac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your h@@ our@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a Fren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his acc@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grand@@ father have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of kids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fruit .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ l@@ ar con@@ ju@@ g@@ ation in all languages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ ere building .
have you already eaten ?
it &apos;s really aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
he always takes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true w@@ arri@@ or .
Tom needs lo@@ ts of courage and pers@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a fortune .
thank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is sil@@ ent and w@@ ag@@ s its tai@@ l .
what did you just say ?
they make a great team .
the se@@ par@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding .
the bicycle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the Internet as a res@@ our@@ ce for my res@@ ear@@ ch .
he said he was poor .
she thinks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this dr@@ aw@@ ing took me five minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your ru@@ les .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re was@@ ting time .
what did you get hit with ?
car@@ s are expensive .
they were not im@@ press@@ ed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his per@@ mission .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ ata in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expensive en@@ gag@@ ement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is twice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the date yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my shoes on .
Tom is an arch@@ it@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the w@@ arri@@ or .
you are not the only one respon@@ sible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to travel with only one su@@ it@@ case .
you &apos;re was@@ ting both of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the stars for n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation .

Tom wants to marry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a pie@@ ce of p@@ ie .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
let &apos;s walk a little fas@@ ter .
I know exactly where I am .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was ei@@ ght years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a hu@@ ge mistake .
breakfast is ser@@ ved .
this is il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the mo@@ od to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without saying go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e ?
we man@@ ag@@ ed to swim acro@@ ss the river .
Mary wants to bre@@ as@@ t@@ fe@@ ed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for lon@@ el@@ iness ?
would you mind speaking more s@@ low@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom poin@@ ted out my mistake .
the pa@@ tro@@ l@@ man mo@@ tion@@ ed me to pu@@ ll over .
I &apos;ll send you a pos@@ t@@ card .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the la@@ w .
she has no less than ten children .
all that g@@ list@@ ers is not go@@ ld .
one of the gu@@ ards is dead .
you owe it to yourself to do it .
parents must pro@@ vide their children with pro@@ per food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are supposed to o@@ be@@ y the la@@ w .
whatever you do , don &apos;t p@@ ush that bu@@ tt@@ on .
I love the out@@ fit you &apos;re wearing .
are you accus@@ ing me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t drive now . you &apos;ve been drin@@ king .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t res@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s OK .
fol@@ low your heart , for it never lies .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in Americ@@ a , wrote us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the contr@@ act is in the bag , so let &apos;s go out and cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate .
accor@@ ding to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have n@@ ine lives .
he was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to S@@ pain on ho@@ li@@ day .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether he should do that or not .
this broken vase cannot be re@@ pai@@ red .
we must have fai@@ th in the pres@@ ident .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to l@@ ess@@ en the imp@@ act of the er@@ r@@ ati@@ c sup@@ p@@ lies .
he has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
do whatever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
we cannot ru@@ le out the possibili@@ ty that ci@@ v@@ il w@@ ar will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl answ@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w sal@@ ad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; should I m@@ ea@@ sure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; you can ey@@ eb@@ all it if you want . &quot;
sig@@ n this .
whose book is this ?
he d@@ anced like a lea@@ f in the au@@ tu@@ m@@ n w@@ ind .
you must be cau@@ ti@@ ous .
she promis@@ ed to meet him at the coffee shop .
he &apos;s very poli@@ te .
pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets may oper@@ ate in this ar@@ ea .
this hat is too small . please show me another one .
they forgot to lo@@ ck the door .
speaking English isn &apos;t easy , but interesting .
we need to remember that .
we must talk her out of this fo@@ o@@ lis@@ h plan .
yes , as far as I know .
I was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing .
it &apos;s cold outside .
please be@@ at the eg@@ gs .
I know it &apos;s un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic to expect Tom to do that .
a wh@@ ale is a mam@@ mal .
I wrote down his phone number on a s@@ cr@@ ap of paper .
I hope it &apos;s not just a curi@@ os@@ ity .
I can &apos;t imagine my life without Tom .
in@@ spi@@ red by her tea@@ ch@@ ers , P@@ har@@ am@@ p is going to start her sol@@ ar car@@ e@@ er tomorrow .
I lost the bet .
are there surviv@@ ors ?

I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re happy .
you &apos;re my best cu@@ stom@@ er .
you had better go .
is this really what you want to do ?
Tom has been absent from school for three days .
you don &apos;t know who I am .
not everything is about you .
ro@@ om@@ s are black .
you don &apos;t need to turn up your ther@@ mo@@ st@@ at when it &apos;s cold outside .
Tom is standing over there near the fi@@ re@@ place .
do you mind if I turn down the TV ?
I tried that .
Tom went to my room .
why are you busy today ?
when he ran into difficul@@ ties , he asked his parents for help .
where did you learn this ?
do you have a ticket ?
I go to the park .
you could hear a p@@ in dro@@ p .
anybody can make a mistake .
she hel@@ ped me out coun@@ t@@ less times .
let &apos;s wait and see how things go .
his wife opened the door for him .
it is not you but her that he wants to marry .
that made me very s@@ ad .
I don &apos;t have time to go to the mo@@ vies .
I want to pay with a check .
there is little milk in the j@@ ar .

we have to make sure that we never do this again .
I like the m@@ el@@ o@@ dy of this s@@ ong .

H@@ ar@@ b@@ in is very cold .
I caught a cold two days ago .
I &apos;m here not because of that .

Tom knew there was something in the box , but he didn &apos;t know what .
I &apos;m in charge here .
che@@ ese and but@@ ter are produc@@ ts made from milk .
R@@ e@@ ag@@ an became P@@ res@@ ident of the Un@@ ited St@@ ates in 19@@ 8@@ 1 .

he was am@@ b@@ ass@@ ado@@ r to the Un@@ ited N@@ ations .
S@@ pi@@ ri@@ t , are you there ?
I don &apos;t bel@@ ong to any clu@@ b .
you seem a little des@@ per@@ ate .
do you think I &apos;m u@@ g@@ ly ?
Tom has a lot of things to do this morning before he leav@@ es the house .
come near the fire .
do you mind if I watch TV for a while ?
he can b@@ end an ir@@ on ro@@ d with his hands .
you &apos;re not allowed to leave this room .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his dog .
he &apos;s promis@@ ing us nothing .
I re@@ comm@@ end it high@@ ly .
that &apos;s all going to change .
he is away from home .
I appreciate anything you can do .
In@@ vite him over to watch a movie .
without lies truth would per@@ ish of des@@ p@@ air and bo@@ re@@ d@@ om .
I have much work today .
tell Tom .
I called him to the tel@@ e@@ phone .
few people can realize their faul@@ ts .
bir@@ ds have sh@@ ar@@ p vision .
who is Tom ?
Mary took the co@@ ok@@ ies out of the o@@ ven .
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
he is something of a cel@@ e@@ bri@@ ty .
life is a my@@ st@@ er@@ y to be lived , not a problem to be sol@@ ved .
I won &apos;t be able to stop .
I don &apos;t know the the@@ ater play , but I know the au@@ th@@ or well .
s@@ ev@@ enty @-@ five di@@ vi@@ ded by five is fi@@ f@@ te@@ en .
coming to work at 4 p@@ .@@ m@@ . is not late .
you party too much .
she refus@@ es to say more about it .
T@@ of@@ u goes well with s@@ ake .
M@@ y@@ S@@ Q@@ L lo@@ ad@@ s s@@ ever@@ al t@@ ables .
I must have gone past the station while I was taking a n@@ ap .
I forgot that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s best friend .
the dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y between the sto@@ ri@@ es of the two parti@@ es invol@@ ved in the accident was so great that the au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties had a hard time deci@@ ding which side was telling the truth .
in case of rain , the ath@@ le@@ tic meeting will be called off .
there is a cat .
be careful !
I love your son .
where are your car keys ?
I think of you as a friend .
you have no need to be as@@ ham@@ ed .
A@@ le@@ j@@ and@@ ra wrote to her pen p@@ al in Ital@@ y .
his ni@@ e@@ ce is attr@@ ac@@ tive and mat@@ ure for her age .
you do like living danger@@ ously .
spring has re@@ turned . the Earth is like a child that knows po@@ ems .
what did I do wrong ?
W@@ i@@ pe your tears .
it took me more than two hours to trans@@ late a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to concentr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not cre@@ ative .
the books were so val@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the great@@ est care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong tree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t start all this .
I wish you could have come with me .
as a matter of fact , all great disco@@ ver@@ ers have been regar@@ ded as dre@@ am@@ ers .
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I promise that you won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed .
can you drive manu@@ al ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I mess@@ ed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a ch@@ ain smo@@ ker .
P@@ eas@@ ants often have a secon@@ d@@ ary acti@@ v@@ ity to aug@@ ment their in@@ come .
our pass@@ por@@ ts were can@@ cel@@ led .
medic@@ ine should be out of the way of children .
that word des@@ cri@@ bes it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
he works for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ key ?
why are you so clu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?
help me .
don &apos;t stay here .
the neigh@@ bo@@ r &apos;s dog is always bar@@ king .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ tai@@ l party .
Tom has agre@@ ed to help us .
I &apos;m super hungry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those problems .
it &apos;s my faul@@ t !
if the situation doesn &apos;t im@@ prove , I &apos;ll be oblig@@ ed to take m@@ ea@@ sures .
I have an umbrella in my car .
whose shoes are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ ef .
do you know where he went ?
the b@@ ear is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ case to your room , sir .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door needs another coat of pain@@ t .
I told you so !
he always went f@@ is@@ hing on the river when he was young .
he has three sons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ prove your Spanish , you shouldn &apos;t have come to C@@ hi@@ le .
I know you like to travel .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the moun@@ t@@ ains and to the sea .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he av@@ eng@@ ed the mu@@ r@@ der of his father .
my watch lo@@ ses ten minutes a day .
he is completely bes@@ ot@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air condi@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was f@@ al@@ sel@@ y acc@@ used .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ pr@@ ess himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a h@@ ea@@ d@@ ache , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ head of s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
Tom rar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ ker .
when we look at other plac@@ es in the uni@@ verse , it could very well be that photo@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exc@@ ep@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be eas@@ ier for students if there were only one single Spanish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the case .
I won &apos;t run away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice seri@@ ously .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday afternoon .
I haven &apos;t told the kids yet that we &apos;re getting div@@ or@@ ced .
let me carry it for you .
I prefer to write in French .
he fai@@ led the entr@@ ance ex@@ am .
someone was here .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a sho@@ wer now .
the house clo@@ s@@ est to here is two mil@@ es away .
her age qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ es her for the job .
he ac@@ ted like a lun@@ ati@@ c .
they can &apos;t do that .
are you list@@ ening ?
I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ris@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dictionary .
if I &apos;d only taken your advice !
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
Sami thinks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my plea@@ sures is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .
were there any stars in the sk@@ y ?
Tom apologi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is gro@@ wing th@@ ick@@ er .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
I &apos;m a lucky man .
Ear@@ ning our cu@@ stom@@ ers confi@@ d@@ ence and respect is this fir@@ m &apos;s objec@@ tive .
what will the neigh@@ b@@ ors think ?
you can &apos;t prove a thing .
this school sup@@ p@@ lies students with tex@@ t@@ books .
his del@@ ay of coming here on time is due to a traffic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
Japan has a lot of tr@@ ade with Can@@ ad@@ a .
sh@@ ut the window to pre@@ vent cat@@ ching a cold .
it &apos;s dangerous here .
Tom took a day off .
the D@@ ead S@@ ea lies bel@@ o@@ w sea lev@@ el .
Mary &apos;s favorite movie is T@@ he P@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ ess B@@ ride .
the situation is under con@@ tro@@ l .
I miss you already .
when did you become a teacher ?
they are my friends .
you might as well go kill yourself .
we play a sport .
he isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I &apos;m just looking out for myself .
he l@@ ac@@ ks t@@ act .
we were concer@@ ned .
A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice wel@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
it was not a complete vic@@ t@@ ory .
we el@@ ected Tom cap@@ tain of the team .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
fun@@ ny !
I can &apos;t do that .
she hand@@ ed me a pos@@ t@@ card .
I just have to do something .
nobody in@@ sul@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was fav@@ orable .
how many col@@ ours are there ?
the language of fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p is not words but me@@ an@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .
I sp@@ ent a week with a P@@ al@@ es@@ tin@@ i@@ an family from G@@ az@@ a .
we &apos;re working to fi@@ x this bu@@ g .
let me con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate you on your en@@ gag@@ ement .
a t@@ sun@@ ami is coming , so please be on the al@@ ert .
why did you tell him that ?
Tom was aw@@ fu@@ l@@ ly bo@@ red .
the nu@@ ll hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is st@@ ates how often a s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing er@@ ro@@ r alone will produ@@ ce res@@ ul@@ ts that are different than a fo@@ rec@@ ast .
at the party there was food in ab@@ un@@ dance .
I want you to speak fran@@ k@@ ly .
they are seeing their uncle tomorrow .
I &apos;m on the inter@@ st@@ ate .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I figured I might find you here .
Tom r@@ ushed past me .
news of her death caus@@ ed great concer@@ n th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the country .
Tom is b@@ it@@ ing his n@@ ails .
how many of you are there now ?
I &apos;m smar@@ ter than you .
you &apos;re very nice .
I couldn &apos;t en@@ ter because the door was closed .
the new t@@ un@@ nel will lin@@ k B@@ ri@@ tain and France .
inst@@ ead of going to school , he stayed at home .
I wish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed .
I must br@@ ush up my English .
it is in the restaurant where Dan e@@ ats lunch .
they g@@ ang@@ ed up on him .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happen@@ ing .
Tom rum@@ mag@@ ed through the dr@@ aw@@ er , looking for a pen@@ c@@ il .
do you need a ride home later ?
I took the little girl by the hand .
my father sp@@ ends a lot of time on his ho@@ b@@ by .
you che@@ ated .
do you know how to play the piano ?
I wanted to make sure you were all right .
you &apos;ve found it .
I don &apos;t understand your res@@ ist@@ ance .
Mon@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
the weather today is worse than yesterday .
I plan to have lunch with him .
she is wat@@ ering the flowers .
I think Tom e@@ ats too much me@@ at .
what direction are you going ?
I wish there were a French transl@@ ation of this book .
down came the rain in tor@@ ren@@ ts .
she tried to com@@ fort him , but he kept crying .
that won &apos;t change anything .
the most was@@ ted day of all is that on which we have not laugh@@ ed .
the way tou@@ ri@@ sts dress off@@ ends lo@@ cal stand@@ ards of pro@@ pri@@ ety .
we can &apos;t give up .
it &apos;s a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ standing .
they want someone to help them .
I &apos;m too tired to ar@@ gue .
that lies outside my ar@@ ea of study .
my uncle has a house in Ital@@ y .
she turned down my off@@ er .
Tom has three boys and a girl .
my boy@@ friend looks like your girlfriend .
Tom was in the sho@@ wer .
we &apos;ll meet at my house .
you &apos;re the teacher .
we &apos;ve lost fai@@ th in hu@@ man@@ ity .
you must &apos;ve thought I was an idiot .
did he forget his money again ?
look out for rock sli@@ des .
the boy caught a large fish .
don &apos;t forget to post the letter .
the plan@@ e accident cost the lives of 2@@ 00 people .
I have lived in Tokyo since 19@@ 8@@ 5 .
she was a bri@@ des@@ m@@ aid at the we@@ d@@ ding .
how do I know that you &apos;re not going to do that again ?
she goes out almost every night .
she &apos;s very tal@@ ented .
come wh@@ en@@ ever it is con@@ ven@@ ient to you .
the s@@ cand@@ al was f@@ at@@ al to his poli@@ ti@@ cal future .
it &apos;s not easy to understand his ide@@ as .
please accep@@ t my sin@@ cer@@ est con@@ do@@ l@@ ences .
he works for an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing ag@@ enc@@ y .
rest here for a bit .
I had never seen a more beautiful sight .
a b@@ y@@ stand@@ er vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed the police be@@ ating using their c@@ ell phone .
I had trouble fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep last night .
Tom &apos;s grand@@ father knew my grand@@ father .
she wr@@ in@@ k@@ led her bro@@ ws .
un@@ fortun@@ ately he re@@ f@@ used to come .
am I on the wrong road ?
the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake sm@@ as@@ hed everything .
I speak H@@ un@@ gar@@ i@@ an .
I spr@@ ang out of bed .
those are your op@@ tions .
I knew that was Tom .
Tom has lived here since 20@@ 0@@ 3 .
I am coun@@ ting on you to d@@ eli@@ ver the o@@ pen@@ ing address .
she walked s@@ low@@ ly for f@@ ear she should sli@@ p .
stop fil@@ ming .
you &apos;re one of my best friends .
do it this way .
if you &apos;re not happy with the money , give it to me . I will be happy .
they were sol@@ di@@ ers .
bro@@ wn is not her natur@@ al hair co@@ lo@@ r .
hasn &apos;t Tom arrived yet ?
when are you going to get married ?
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
Tom bl@@ ushed back .
Tom thinks Mary is u@@ g@@ ly .
they ar@@ gue a lot .
none of you should leave this room .
Tom works in ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing .
a woman &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th is in her ton@@ gue .
clothes are behind me .
some of the photos have been taken at the ris@@ k of life .
that box is heavy .
where were you born ?
it was very different from what I had imagin@@ ed .
do you have everything ?
the reason is clear .
he said the truth .
a man of sense would be as@@ ham@@ ed to do so .
he is not too poor to buy a bicycle .
Tom can &apos;t help .
you &apos;re lo@@ sing .
it is best that we speak with a spec@@ i@@ alis@@ t .
the 2@@ 6@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber is the Euro@@ pe@@ an D@@ ay of L@@ ang@@ u@@ ages . the C@@ oun@@ c@@ il of Europe wants to dr@@ a@@ w attention to the mul@@ ti@@ lin@@ gu@@ al her@@ it@@ age of Europe , to fo@@ st@@ er the ev@@ o@@ lution of mul@@ ti@@ lin@@ gu@@ alis@@ m in soci@@ ety and to en@@ courage ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to learn languages โ โ . Tatoeba , as an easy @-@ to @-@ use learning to@@ ol and an ac@@ tive commun@@ ity , prom@@ o@@ tes the study and appreci@@ ation of languages in a very practi@@ cal way .
lo@@ ck the door .
the l@@ ack of ev@@ id@@ ence to the contr@@ ary is it@@ self ev@@ id@@ ence that your theory is probably right .
people once believ@@ ed the world was fl@@ at .
don &apos;t p@@ ush me very hard . it &apos;s dangerous .
bring a lunch .
I &apos;ll be with you fore@@ ver .
I go to work .
where &apos;s the key ?
I &apos;m very hungry .
you have cute eyes .
you &apos;re reading .
I am sorry .
remember to ren@@ ew your pass@@ port .
I don &apos;t have a ticket .
I &apos;d like to come home now .
she demand@@ ed to see the man@@ ager .
is he at home ?
the next day , at sup@@ per@@ time , I was introdu@@ ced to her husband .
that &apos;s how it is .
how many people are there in your family ?
someone turned the al@@ ar@@ m off .
do you believe that there &apos;s life after death ?
I had a promise to keep .
aren &apos;t you hungry ?
mine is not so good as yours .
let &apos;s eat a wat@@ er@@ m@@ el@@ on !
please tell me how you plan to do that .
the strange obj@@ ect in the sk@@ y could be seen with the un@@ ai@@ ded eye .
Tom is cl@@ aus@@ tr@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ c .
our anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors came to this country 1@@ 5@@ 0 years ago .
I have never sun@@ g , and never will sing , in a k@@ ar@@ a@@ o@@ ke b@@ ar .
the gen@@ ie is out of the bo@@ ttle .
H@@ on@@ es@@ tly , Tom , I can &apos;t remember . it was more than 10 years ago .
who is born to be h@@ ang@@ ed will never be dro@@ w@@ ned .
how do you know I &apos;m not the one who did it ?
he wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
I &apos;d like to get started right away .
I &apos;m thirty .
commun@@ is@@ m will never be re@@ ach@@ ed in my li@@ fe@@ time .
the sun will become a red gi@@ ant in about 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on years .
I figured it out by myself .
there is a world of differ@@ ence between , &quot; some@@ how being understood &quot; and &quot; using correct English . &quot;
I as@@ su@@ me that &apos;s a jo@@ ke .
Euro@@ pe@@ ans drink , on av@@ er@@ age , 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 li@@ ters of pu@@ re al@@ co@@ ho@@ l per year .
if you &apos;re going to apologi@@ ze , you should do it right away .
the bu@@ ll@@ et found its mar@@ k .
I &apos;m star@@ ting to get used to the food here .
I &apos;m not going to for@@ ce you to do that .
he id@@ les away his time .
it didn &apos;t not work .
there is an old cas@@ t@@ le at the fo@@ ot of the mountain .
you told me that you were tired .
if the spec@@ tat@@ ors made fun of the other team , then it would wea@@ ken their mor@@ ale .
I &apos;m press@@ ing char@@ ges .
he succ@@ ee@@ ded in the exam@@ in@@ ation at his first at@@ tem@@ pt .
when the cur@@ tain went up , the st@@ age was dark .
I am un@@ com@@ fortable in these new shoes .
we must pay attention to the traffic light .
he did all the le@@ g@@ work .
don &apos;t leave the bicycle in the rain .
I like milk .
the river flo@@ ws down to the sea .
you tell him the truth .
the old profes@@ so@@ r &apos;s l@@ ec@@ tures are long @-@ win@@ ded and pon@@ der@@ ous .
I &apos;m lucky to have a job .
you &apos;ve really turned black now .
have you tried it ?
what time do you get up every day ?
we will im@@ pl@@ ement a re@@ consi@@ dered N@@ or@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th co@@ oper@@ ation me@@ chan@@ is@@ m .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to spend her summer vacation .
I didn &apos;t realize you were aw@@ ake .
sh@@ ut up , you &apos;re dis@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting me .
you don &apos;t live in a country ; you live in a language . your hom@@ el@@ and , that &apos;s that and nothing else .
I will wait here until he comes back .
why aren &apos;t you studying ?
I can &apos;t make it to your party next weekend .
where &apos;s everybody else ?
the lo@@ a@@ f is small .
we try to ex@@ plain things acro@@ ss cul@@ tures ; in sp@@ ite of b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
they bur@@ ned .
I &apos;ve lost my reli@@ gi@@ ous fai@@ th .
did you talk about me ?
you must not go out at night .
all I want is your cat .
we began on a new pro@@ ject .
I have to leave on Mon@@ day .
I want to be more than friends .
I don &apos;t know how to cont@@ act you .
your com@@ ic books are on the sh@@ el@@ f .
a sa@@ di@@ st is always at the same time a mas@@ o@@ ch@@ ist .
I &apos;m just not very hungry .
I &apos;ve given this quite a lot of thought .
call an am@@ bu@@ l@@ ance .
she said that she had to be back before d@@ a@@ wn .
I thought you were inju@@ red .
I want to see more .
she d@@ anced with jo@@ y .
why are you st@@ aying ?
how are you going to get home ?
do you think I look like my brother ?
I just couldn &apos;t help myself .
cl@@ ou@@ ds bl@@ ac@@ ken the sk@@ y ( and everyone &apos;s mo@@ od ) .
could you please sh@@ ar@@ pen these kni@@ ves ?
my father might be at home now .
the man was no better than a hor@@ se .
you spend too much time with her .
I have no fun@@ ds in the b@@ ank .
that &apos;s kind of v@@ ag@@ ue .
you started crying .
I feel bad for them .
I thought you wanted a div@@ or@@ ce .
there &apos;s no need for you to pre@@ p@@ are a for@@ mal speech .
you are ho@@ p@@ el@@ ess !
where did you go to school ?
I also like you .
we &apos;ve just cle@@ an@@ ed the toil@@ ets .
I &apos;m trav@@ el@@ ing light .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
they hun@@ g their co@@ ats behind the door .
Christ@@ op@@ her C@@ o@@ lu@@ m@@ bus once cut himself with a kni@@ fe . it made him so angry that he then cut the kni@@ fe ... with himself .
did anyone see you on the b@@ each ?
everyone did it .
it is impossible for him to do it .
she used to wash her hair before going to school .
I &apos;ve already seen the film .
she kept her eyes closed .
you &apos;re not allowed in here .
Tom no@@ d@@ ded quickly .
I need money in gener@@ al , not just now .
we didn &apos;t see her any@@ where .
this is for you .
at last , the end @-@ of @-@ ter@@ m exam@@ s are over .
it is not given to everybody to study abroad .
I really hope you &apos;re right .
we have to respect lo@@ cal cu@@ stom@@ s .
I &apos;m quite happy .
Tom &apos;s lap@@ top has a tou@@ ch@@ p@@ ad .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t put it into words .
have you seen my keys ?
Tom only drin@@ ks water .
where do you get off telling me that ?
get fu@@ cked in the ass !
children are fon@@ d of cake .
you really do have a beautiful vo@@ ice .
I &apos;ll never for@@ give you .
that &apos;s very good .
he hur@@ ried so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
you &apos;re not thinking c@@ lear@@ ly .
he is far from being hon@@ est .
have you ever sh@@ a@@ ken with cold ?
I &apos;m glad you called .
we &apos;re doing all we can .
how about having a bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e party next Sun@@ day ?
you &apos;re double @-@ par@@ ked .
or@@ anges are sw@@ e@@ et@@ er than l@@ em@@ ons .
it &apos;s not necessary to write more than 4@@ 00 words .
she gave me her phone number .
sel@@ ling car@@ s is my job .
ten years is a long time to wait .
it &apos;s re@@ d@@ un@@ d@@ ant .
it is going to rain soon .
how do I tell my parents that I &apos;m pre@@ gn@@ ant ?
Tom didn &apos;t pay me as much as he promis@@ ed he would .
tell them who you are .
he has a nice body .
I re@@ cor@@ ded you sin@@ ging .
we used to live in K@@ o@@ be .
you may as well get used to it .
I will wait for a week .
this morning I got up ear@@ li@@ er than usual .
I stayed at a nice hotel .
do black ho@@ les exist ?
how come your Spanish is that good ?
I &apos;m not sel@@ fish .
it is too early to go to bed .
good hab@@ its should be cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ated in chil@@ d@@ hood .
it &apos;s getting late . I don &apos;t wan@@ n@@ a go home alone .
your pro@@ fi@@ le photo is un@@ profes@@ si@@ on@@ al .
winter does not look real without snow .
tell me what Tom took with him .
I want the truth from you .
call me after you talk to Tom .
S@@ y@@ d@@ ne@@ y is far from here .
I want you to go to the post office .
he gave in his pro@@ ject late .
I think Tom is still sleeping .
he was bur@@ sting with fu@@ ry .
nervous ? me ? no !
you said there was an em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
you really lu@@ cked out on this one .
I take a vacation this week .
I have work to do .
you won &apos;t find a dog bi@@ g@@ ger than this one .
I met her at a dinner party .
W@@ ho@@ ever wants it may take it .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
you &apos;re just a co@@ ward .
pain@@ ting is another thing I can do fai@@ r@@ ly well .
D@@ is@@ ti@@ ll@@ ed water has no t@@ as@@ te .
there are two cats sleeping on the bed .
you have to promise not to tell anyone .
I am interested in music .
it &apos;s a was@@ te of time and money .
I &apos;ll try to get a l@@ ay of the land before I start contribu@@ ting .
I was having breakfast when I saw the fire in the gard@@ en .
every time I join a new game of W@@ ar@@ cr@@ af@@ t , I am p@@ itted against a new team of ad@@ vers@@ ar@@ ies .
I liked them before they became popular .
this dictionary is of great val@@ ue to us .
a st@@ ar sh@@ ines on the hour of our meeting .
here we took the bo@@ at for Al@@ as@@ k@@ a .
she has a son and two daugh@@ ters .
I didn &apos;t want to do this in the first place .
I have always felt that you always knew that Sami was your son .
we all have arrived .
I &apos;m on cru@@ t@@ ches for the next month .
I cannot stop the ble@@ e@@ ding .
he is always trying to do the impossible .
don &apos;t comp@@ lic@@ ate the problem by rais@@ ing new issu@@ es .

are those your daugh@@ ters ?
I don &apos;t want to miss my train .
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
we don &apos;t know what they want to use it for .
eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers try to take adv@@ antage of nature rather than try to understand it .
do you work here ?
I saw land in the distance .
that &apos;s a good guess .
the pri@@ son@@ er es@@ cap@@ ed under co@@ ver of night .

Tom bought an expensive Christmas present for himself .
he almost never went there .
what did you want to show us ?
don &apos;t try to be a her@@ o .
in his face !
I &apos;m one of you .
I don &apos;t want to be any more bur@@ d@@ en to my parents .

Sami decided to turn a bl@@ ind eye to the truth .
Tom had a difficult job .
that has nothing to do with it .
would you like to try it again ?
life is too short , really !
he fai@@ led to come yesterday .
Tom wants to be a diplom@@ at .
he went there , never to re@@ turn .
I conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated it .
I don &apos;t want to tell him .
what kind of mist@@ akes did you make ?
I wasn &apos;t the one driving the car .
Tom pat@@ ted me on the back and con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ated me .
P@@ et@@ er was an al@@ tru@@ is@@ tic video game play@@ er ; he would give it@@ ems to people who needed them , rather than sel@@ ling them for pers@@ on@@ al prof@@ it .

it &apos;s not poli@@ te to st@@ are at others .
she went with him to the zoo .
he was s@@ col@@ ded by his teacher for being l@@ azy .

it is about time you married .
the milk &apos;s a bit off .
my husband is in j@@ ail .
if I knew his address , I would get in touch with him right away .
Tom found something .
I had an umbrella with me but my friend did not .
I can &apos;t fi@@ x the se@@ at .
he igno@@ red her advice .
there was something off in Sami &apos;s life .
you will be p@@ aid accor@@ ding to your abili@@ ty .

when he asked who had broken the window , all the boys put on an air of inno@@ c@@ ence .
did you miss me ?
that &apos;s the har@@ d@@ est part .
I don &apos;t know for certain .
what time do you turn off the li@@ ghts ?
I have to say I en@@ v@@ y you .
his trou@@ bles are not over .
I &apos;m not sure what it was , but it s@@ oun@@ ded like a g@@ un@@ shot .

he saw in her eyes that she still loved him and hope ar@@ ose inside him .
I don &apos;t even know how old Tom is .
I s@@ lic@@ ed the sandwich di@@ ag@@ on@@ ally .
she should have kept her mou@@ th sh@@ ut .
I think love does not exist .
I guess my lu@@ ck just ran out .
he plays bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball best of us all .
the dec@@ ision is still not de@@ fin@@ ite .
it seems she is over thirty years old .

I &apos;ve asked you re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly to do that .
the music c@@ arried me back to my chil@@ d@@ hood .

I had to go back .
nobody sup@@ por@@ ted my country .
I &apos;ll tell her where I went .

who are you sel@@ ling your car to ?
she speaks English as if she were a n@@ ative spea@@ ker .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
I don &apos;t like both of you going to such a place .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to live .
I &apos;m not happy with my looks .
I had to work over@@ time yesterday .
it &apos;ll be us three : you , me , and An@@ ne .
they acc@@ used him of telling a lie .
I &apos;m sorry if I s@@ n@@ app@@ ed at you .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
last week five students were absent from class .
Sami sp@@ illed his drink in the store .
you don &apos;t have what it takes to be a lea@@ der .
I don &apos;t like feeling so po@@ wer@@ less .
nothing makes Tom happy .
Tom was late for dinner .
I am glad that the matter was s@@ et@@ t@@ led am@@ ic@@ ab@@ ly .
you &apos;re s@@ lo@@ sh@@ ed .
do you have anything to say to us ?
we pass@@ ed by the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ y before coming home .

I eat fruit and drink water .
I didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
I started the fire .
in the store , they bought the nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties and the super@@ flu@@ ous .
let &apos;s keep an eye on this .
I bet you &apos;re talking about Tom .

I think that you have my umbrella .
my children like school .
I can &apos;t help taking pain@@ k@@ ill@@ ers when I have a h@@ ea@@ d@@ ache .
I didn &apos;t say it made sense .
he dro@@ w@@ ned while swimming in the river .
can &apos;t you hear all the car hor@@ n@@ s hon@@ king behind us ?
is that yours ?
time will always take re@@ ven@@ ge on those who forget about it .
hurry up or you &apos;ll be late .
they tru@@ sted you .
Tom was ob@@ vi@@ ously dis@@ gu@@ sted .
I want to do that now .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .
I won &apos;t tell you why I did that .
the man died of canc@@ er .
I have nothing to do with the matter .
w@@ ind the clock .
my cr@@ am school is a long way from here .

I thought you &apos;d be full after eating that big st@@ ea@@ k .
how long have you been doing this ?
you should try it on .
look out ! there &apos;s a tru@@ ck coming !
I thought I knew all your secrets .
we &apos;re kee@@ ping all op@@ tions open at this point .
his en@@ coun@@ ter with her is en@@ ri@@ ching his in@@ ner life .

while I was swimming , I got a cr@@ am@@ p in my le@@ g .
I need not have wat@@ ered the flowers . just after I finished it started rain@@ ing .
you should go now .

they &apos;ve reali@@ zed they should stop dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation against g@@ ays .
the well d@@ eli@@ vers a great deal of o@@ il .
I &apos;m on my way .
I remember seeing her .
who is that boy ?
he didn &apos;t have time to spend with his children .
what choice did I have ?
please don &apos;t l@@ au@@ gh at me .

it is a small dog .
it is vit@@ al that you be present .
what did they say ?
French is a very beautiful language .
can you imagine ? In@@ de@@ ed , the squ@@ are ro@@ ot of min@@ us one is &apos; i &apos; .

I need a taxi !
what is it you really want to tell me ?

it happen@@ s more often than you would think .
you may cho@@ ose one of them .
why did you absent yourself from class yesterday ?
he is ho@@ l@@ ding his books under his ar@@ m .
do not drink too much br@@ and@@ y !
don &apos;t talk to me about him .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
I didn &apos;t realize you could speak French .
where did you get that or@@ ange scar@@ f ?
the story turned my blood cold .
because there are a lot of vol@@ can@@ o@@ es , it is easy for Japan to be hit by ear@@ th@@ qu@@ akes .
I &apos;m looking for people to speak E@@ s@@ per@@ anto with .
I just started crying .
this book is too expensive .

sh@@ ame be to him who thinks ev@@ il of it .

I didn &apos;t want you to feel you were alone .
I am spe@@ e@@ ch@@ less .

sooner or later , I &apos;ll probably visit Boston .
Tom dr@@ ank three bo@@ tt@@ les of wine by himself last night .
I wish there were some hot girls in my class .
the company didn &apos;t immediately respon@@ d to re@@ ques@@ ts for comment .
I enjoy swimming .
how do you say that in French ?
I &apos;d kill for a beer right now .
Tom was wearing a w@@ ire .
who are you tex@@ ting ?
you shouldn &apos;t read in such poor light .
would you like to eat something ?
happy is the man who is content with his lot .
that &apos;s why I asked .
the com@@ ic books were p@@ il@@ ed on the des@@ k .
I want to play .
I &apos;m sure Tom was invol@@ ved .
Tom has a lot of to@@ ys .
this is an old building .
do you believe in g@@ ho@@ sts ?
am I being acc@@ used of mu@@ r@@ der ?
I &apos;ve been very busy since the new ter@@ m started .
I &apos;m much older than you are .
when did Tom arrive ?
I can &apos;t wait to meet him .
that &apos;s n@@ on@@ sense . nobody but a fo@@ ol would believe it .
Tom is a good b@@ ass play@@ er .
I just can &apos;t figure it out .
if you &apos;d listen , you &apos;d understand .
which one was your favorite ?
you &apos;ll call me , won &apos;t you ?
I learned French in Paris .
I caught a fish !
he never coun@@ ts on my help .

you shouldn &apos;t have p@@ aid the bill .
I sugg@@ est that you take a n@@ ap .

why does he have to do that ?
this is the man for you to speak to .
the student mis@@ sed class three times in a row .
if I had known about your ill@@ ness , I could have vis@@ ited you in the hospital .
give me a ring if you find out anything .
it &apos;s just not worth it .

don &apos;t touch the flowers .

I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to do that .
you only think about having fun .
I cannot make no@@ ise . the baby is sleeping .
how do you deal with it ?
let &apos;s wait an hour .
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day .
I wonder what it could be .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I br@@ ought you another blan@@ ket .
S@@ am is two years youn@@ ger than Tom .

I &apos;m w@@ ill@@ ing to help you if you want me to .

Mary always y@@ el@@ ls when she &apos;s angry .
Tom tried to hu@@ la ho@@ o@@ p .
per@@ hap@@ s you are mist@@ a@@ ken .
if the times go against you , then go with the times .

Mary was lucky to find her keys .
it began to snow .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a present for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may cho@@ ose wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever you want .
I never talked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this concert was aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
what is life without the radi@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ get@@ table place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ dis@@ pu@@ table fact that Americ@@ ans are , as Americ@@ ans , the most self @-@ con@@ sci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ dic@@ ted to the beli@@ ef that the other n@@ ations of the earth are in a con@@ spir@@ ac@@ y to under@@ val@@ ue them .
we &apos;re sun@@ k .
do not under@@ esti@@ m@@ ate my po@@ wer .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ cked up .
I bet you &apos;re right .
have some coffee .
un@@ fortun@@ ately , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ du@@ c@@ ated people .
the wri@@ ter does not always present life as it is .
language and cul@@ ture can &apos;t be se@@ par@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a taxi stand near the station .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ a@@ tra &apos;s no@@ se had been shor@@ ter , the history of the world would be different .
his room was small but clean , and the food was good .
his sle@@ ev@@ e tou@@ ched the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a sac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
Smith has sp@@ ent years studying the effec@@ ts of sleep and sleep lo@@ ss on mem@@ ory and learning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of exerci@@ se .
the cat ru@@ ined my sof@@ a .
we &apos;re less than hal@@ f@@ way to the top of the mountain . are you already tired ?
con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations !
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly feeling down in the du@@ m@@ ps .
they &apos;re all on vacation .
if you can , come with us .
I trust Tom &apos;s ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to become the man@@ ager .
a cro@@ w@@ d was g@@ ath@@ ering around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she died of tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ s@@ is .
it was your mistake .
it was very ru@@ de of you to say a thing like that .
these tex@@ ts were written in H@@ e@@ bre@@ w , not in A@@ ram@@ ai@@ c .
you look famili@@ ar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a tour of Americ@@ a , stop@@ ping in six ci@@ ties .
M@@ r@@ . Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ is@@ h@@ es his son would study har@@ der .
I have no faul@@ ts .

I need a little help here .
you &apos;re going to have to pay for the re@@ p@@ air .
take things as they are .
it is rain@@ ing now .
you &apos;re too susp@@ ici@@ ous about everything .
so t@@ as@@ ty !
I &apos;ve never had problems before .
I probably should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the di@@ sh@@ clo@@ ths with the servi@@ ettes .
I thought he would be up@@ set .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the shor@@ test @-@ lived profes@@ sions there is .
the milk is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he appe@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be impossible to get a completely er@@ ro@@ r @-@ free cor@@ p@@ us due to the nature of this kind of coll@@ abor@@ ative effor@@ t . H@@ ow@@ ever , if we en@@ courage mem@@ b@@ ers to contribu@@ te sentences in their own languages rather than experi@@ ment in languages they are learning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ ize er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the wor@@ st thing you can do !
has he got any experience of f@@ ar@@ ming ?
Tom knows the city very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ ined everything .
because they &apos;re watching television .
we &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
write your address here .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he was a w@@ and@@ ering pe@@ dd@@ ler .

time to ri@@ se and sh@@ ine .
he did it any@@ way .
the pay is terrible and the hours are long .
how old is the uni@@ verse ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wife is six mon@@ ths pre@@ gn@@ ant with our first son .

I said nothing about the matter .
I hur@@ ried so as not to miss the train .
I was so afraid that no one would ask me to dance .
time pass@@ es , and it tur@@ n@@ s the whe@@ el of life as water does that of a m@@ ill .
which way is the che@@ ese sh@@ el@@ f ?
if I told you , you wouldn &apos;t understand .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like the same kind of music .
she can &apos;t find her keys .

I can &apos;t solve this problem .
she s@@ ays you &apos;re cute .
the dog was bar@@ king .
my father makes it a ru@@ le to get up at six , even in winter .
I feel way more com@@ fortable now .
she ad@@ m@@ itted to having her@@ oin .
I didn &apos;t try to kill anybody .
why don &apos;t you come visit us ?
I didn &apos;t know they were d@@ ating .
one must wait for the res@@ i@@ du@@ als to con@@ ver@@ ge before being able to use the si@@ mul@@ ation &apos;s res@@ ul@@ ts .
they &apos;re co@@ o@@ king now .
I can &apos;t live without a TV .
we &apos;re past that .
my father used to eat at this restaurant .
we should tell Tom the truth .
are you a poli@@ c@@ eman ?
she is exac@@ t in all the instruc@@ tions she gives .
they left the movie early .

we came by to wish you lu@@ ck .
I &apos;m yours .
they never talk but they qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l .
we &apos;re tr@@ app@@ ed !
I want to see them .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
one is never so happy as one thinks .
I have nothing to say about that .
does Tom drink ?
I know what we can do .
I can &apos;t really remember .
no one war@@ ned us .
she doesn &apos;t remember anything .
are you still plan@@ ning to qu@@ it your job ?
Layla wo@@ re an ab@@ ay@@ a .

I appreciate it .
they live do@@ w@@ n@@ stairs .
he put a st@@ am@@ p on the letter .
is it all wrong ?
I had to get something out of the car .
long time no see .
I want to , but I can &apos;t .

at least the work is done .
nothing is so val@@ u@@ able as fri@@ end@@ shi@@ p .
I don &apos;t date .

my friend hel@@ ped me .
how do you respon@@ d to that ?
I &apos;m not crazy .
dinner &apos;s ready .
do you think Tom wants to eat now ?
I want you to help us .
I think you made the right choice .
what were you studying last night ?
I &apos;m dis@@ appointed and angry .
&quot; do you want to go to the ball with me ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really sorry , but I can &apos;t . &quot;
we walked to my room .
we &apos;re too close .
we didn &apos;t learn anything .
he lives pay@@ check to pay@@ check .
you should get ri@@ d of that bad hab@@ it .
this city has a bike @-@ sh@@ ar@@ ing service .
don &apos;t try to carry too much .
some girls are natur@@ ally pretty .
is that your own hair ?
my parents said it &apos;s bad lu@@ ck to walk on your k@@ ne@@ es .
I want to avo@@ id r@@ ush hour .
he makes moun@@ t@@ ains out of mo@@ le@@ h@@ ill@@ s .

I started with two trav@@ el@@ ing comp@@ an@@ ions .
what &apos;s the name of that bir@@ d ?
I can &apos;t go with you .
I as@@ su@@ me you &apos;ve heard from Tom .

good thing I learned English .
you have a watch .
can I touch your hair ?
just do it .
do you want this shirt ?
what condi@@ tion is the building in ?
no matter how hard I try , I can &apos;t do it any better than she can .
she was horri@@ fied .
her French has gotten much better .
the door is lo@@ cked .
you might want to take a look at this .
all you have to do is to concentr@@ ate .
would you be w@@ ill@@ ing to send me a s@@ am@@ ple free of charge ?
French isn &apos;t my n@@ ative language .
we &apos;re all very good play@@ ers .
it &apos;s as cold as ice .
I &apos;m sick of this .
I want everything to be perf@@ ect .
what were you waiting for ?
you can &apos;t attend ? why not ?
for all our efforts , things have not turned out better .
Tom should pay what he ow@@ es .
are you about done ?
what time does your watch say it is now ?
you need to be more patient .
there is an ur@@ gent need for blood don@@ ors .
he &apos;s too tru@@ sting .

Mary sle@@ e@@ ps a lot .

he went to art school to study pain@@ ting and s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture .
I can &apos;t tell you how much your sup@@ port me@@ ans to us .
I can now die a happy man .
you don &apos;t look very com@@ fortable .
you shouldn &apos;t be afraid of the future .
we &apos;ve been aband@@ oned .
I was a vic@@ ti@@ m of a pic@@ k@@ po@@ cket .
since there was no taxi , I had to walk home .
du@@ ring my chil@@ d@@ hood , I often came here to ob@@ ser@@ ve the sur@@ r@@ oun@@ din@@ gs and me@@ di@@ t@@ ate .
no , you don &apos;t know J@@ av@@ a . you know J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ C@@ R@@ I@@ P@@ T .

Tom sh@@ av@@ ed off his be@@ ard and d@@ yed his hair bl@@ on@@ de , ho@@ ping people wouldn &apos;t reco@@ gni@@ ze him .
my ho@@ b@@ by is to cook .
who do you think can help me ?
do you have an autom@@ o@@ bi@@ le ?
in au@@ tu@@ m@@ n , the mo@@ on is very beautiful .
you know what might happen , don &apos;t you ?
I owe what I am today to my parents .
I &apos;m coming to your res@@ cu@@ e !
if I &apos;d known the truth , I &apos;d have told you .
she ser@@ ved me coffee .
English cannot be mas@@ tered over@@ night .
the beautiful is always strange .
I think I could hand@@ le that .
I had a good time , too .
my time has not yet come .
he &apos;s a go@@ al kee@@ per .
that &apos;s very big .
it &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
this is seri@@ ous , Tom .
you &apos;re all alone .
I &apos;ll ex@@ plain it all later .
you &apos;ll have a wonder@@ ful time .
he wants to re@@ ach a wi@@ der au@@ di@@ ence .
I always walk .
I owe my succ@@ ess to my friends .
I think we &apos;re out of danger .
it was pretty b@@ all@@ s@@ y of you to stand up to the bo@@ ss like that .
I &apos;m on your side .
we used to play mus@@ ical ch@@ airs in el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school .
B@@ ar@@ bar@@ a reg@@ al@@ ed us with am@@ az@@ ing sto@@ ri@@ es about her trip to T@@ i@@ bet .
where do you get off telling me that ?
can you pay me in adv@@ ance ?
&quot; are you seri@@ ous ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m absolu@@ tel@@ y seri@@ ous . &quot;
I fi@@ red the gun .
Oh you poor little thing .
he ju@@ m@@ ped into the water .
I &apos;ve finished .
I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an older woman .
every mo@@ vement is pain@@ ful .
she liked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did war@@ n you .
that &apos;s my car .
I &apos;m not going to do that until Mon@@ day .
I me@@ ant to call her , but I forgot to .
you don &apos;t look very strong .
I completely appro@@ ve of this .
Tom took part in the summer f@@ esti@@ v@@ al .
they caught Tom .
she was absent from school because she was sick .
everybody wants per@@ man@@ ent p@@ ea@@ ce .
her sor@@ row was only appar@@ ent .
Jane looks very p@@ ale .
Tom comm@@ itted suici@@ de in pri@@ son .
Tom is a m@@ ember of the S@@ W@@ A@@ T team .
they had to change their s@@ che@@ du@@ le because the train arrived late .
&quot; quiet , &quot; he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed .
you seem to know everything .
in two mo@@ ves , K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v will check the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger .
I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese cul@@ ture and history .
she looked trou@@ bl@@ ed by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me nervous .
do you mind much ?
it is cl@@ ou@@ dy now .
the show star@@ ts at noon .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very under@@ standing .
French is my favorite language .
I think that she &apos;s hi@@ ding something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .
she thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to set our house on fire .
the wh@@ ale is well known to be the lar@@ g@@ est mam@@ mal .
that &apos;s true for every day exc@@ ept one .
Sami knows this hood like the back of his hand .
the ris@@ ks are too great .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en C@@ ol@@ ber@@ t is a pretty crazy gu@@ y .
give it back to me .
Mr Smith tea@@ ches me English .
the el@@ ev@@ at@@ or seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time cho@@ o@@ sing whether I should listen to reason or my feelings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to wash my car .
you should get that sof@@ a reu@@ pho@@ l@@ st@@ ered .
the old woman is too wea@@ k to get out of bed .
even if it co@@ sts 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 00 yen , I must buy the dictionary .
he is so old that he cannot walk quickly .
please wait a moment .
pre@@ p@@ are yourself .
they ad@@ m@@ itted they were scar@@ ed .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjoy sp@@ end@@ ing time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ and@@ er up .
it &apos;s a fruit .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of eating at the school caf@@ et@@ er@@ ia .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a message ?
how lon@@ ely and hel@@ pl@@ ess she must feel left all by herself !
as the first p@@ ack em@@ erg@@ es , the spec@@ tat@@ ors take pic@@ tures with their cam@@ er@@ as and mo@@ bi@@ le ph@@ ones .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I needed to eat less cand@@ y .
I didn &apos;t s@@ cre@@ am .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can ex@@ plain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy h@@ ou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the gar@@ age .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a solution .
he &apos;s gone into hi@@ ding .
Mr B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ anci@@ al advis@@ er .
I am an arti@@ st .
you should buy her new to@@ ys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ p@@ ping b@@ all@@ s .
she is nothing to him .
Ju@@ li@@ an w@@ ears r@@ ound glasses like John L@@ enn@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fi@@ red from your last job ?
I like fun@@ ny guys .
I usually get up at ei@@ ght .
there is a big park near my school .

we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it r@@ ains .
is it possible to det@@ er@@ mine the di@@ am@@ et@@ er from the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
and on sun@@ ny days all the pi@@ ge@@ ons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feeling OK ?
Sami res@@ em@@ bles the susp@@ ect .

we believe in a better world .
is she still single ?
I didn &apos;t enjoy the party at all .

we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dark outside .
I can &apos;t read Ar@@ ab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they h@@ ated Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t agree with the theory that one should learn L@@ ati@@ n in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being seri@@ ous !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .
please pic@@ k me up by car in front of the hotel .

under nor@@ mal condi@@ tions , the bo@@ il@@ ing point of water is 1@@ 00 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my ap@@ petite away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve eaten in an Ital@@ i@@ an pi@@ zz@@ er@@ ia .
no one can den@@ y the fact .
abo@@ ve all things , we must not be sel@@ fish .
I have difficul@@ ty concentr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ wel@@ ling on the plea@@ sures of the past .
I &apos;ll stay invol@@ ved .
this happened pri@@ or to rec@@ e@@ iv@@ ing your letter .
Tom likes te@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ y .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is blu@@ e .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the go@@ vernment is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the cur@@ ren@@ c@@ y to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ it@@ ing .
ac@@ id rain is not a natur@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
we should pres@@ erve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
I can get us there more quickly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ m@@ p@@ et .
I think that fact is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I owe you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
carry these books back to the boo@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f .
have a nice trip .
the train is leaving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?
that has nothing to do with this .
is this f@@ ake ?
my father always read@@ s the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper before breakfast .
Tom told me he &apos;d already eaten .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
she plays the flu@@ te .
they look so cute together .
Tom wi@@ ped his glasses .
it really h@@ its the n@@ ail on the head .
she has inter@@ nation@@ al ren@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom sli@@ p and fall .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with num@@ b@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I buil@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concert because he had to work .
he &apos;s broke .
she is far from hon@@ est .
there are good gr@@ ounds for the view that Paris was the s@@ cen@@ e of f@@ requ@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ vo@@ lution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef out@@ line of the plan .
if I were you , I would ignore it .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in this country .
I want a don@@ ut .
I &apos;m in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks wor@@ ried .
I obj@@ ect to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a sandwich &quot; B@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory is where we study every day .
I like these h@@ ats .
we &apos;ll dec@@ ide later .
last winter , I went sk@@ i@@ ing in Can@@ ad@@ a .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
this sof@@ a can se@@ at three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t expect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please pre@@ p@@ are for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or single ? do you live alone or are you in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p ?
the sk@@ y is clear . not a cl@@ ou@@ d in sight .
I &apos;m not stop@@ ping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting down is not all that bad .
check these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it correc@@ tly .
Tom is as t@@ all as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s dangerous for children to swim in this l@@ ake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleeping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necessary .
an en@@ orm@@ ous space station ori@@ b@@ it@@ ing around J@@ up@@ it@@ er over@@ looked the rain@@ bo@@ w stri@@ pes of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the inju@@ red were re@@ mo@@ ved from the s@@ cen@@ e .
the train is arriv@@ ing !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cu@@ re for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the res@@ ul@@ t .
do not be sh@@ y . your pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the air was hu@@ mi@@ d and lu@@ k@@ e@@ war@@ m .
of course , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost scar@@ ed me not to see you on@@ line for a whole day .
she is as fl@@ at as a p@@ anc@@ ake .
this article is more interesting than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you hit your children ?
beau@@ ty pleas@@ es the eyes , kin@@ d@@ ness en@@ ch@@ ants the sou@@ l .
our plan went wrong from the begin@@ ning .
I don &apos;t enjoy tea@@ ching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reas@@ ons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need te@@ a ?
a child should not get more sp@@ end@@ ing money than is necessary .
the pi@@ zz@@ a is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his su@@ dd@@ en appe@@ ar@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom ran out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a profes@@ si@@ on@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all game .
Tom &apos;s innocent .
everyone g@@ ath@@ ered together for the picture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is je@@ al@@ ous .
please re@@ fer to the tou@@ ri@@ st information office .
don &apos;t leave the front door open .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be coming .

Tom and Mary was@@ hed the di@@ sh@@ es together .
Tom is watching .
bes@@ ides the rain , we experi@@ enc@@ ed heavy win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but we@@ al@@ thy town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the s@@ even sac@@ ram@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing you .
does Tom still r@@ ely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted cl@@ ari@@ fication .
let &apos;s worry about that later .
he hurt his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to res@@ cu@@ e him .
I figured out a way to make more money .
this job gives me the hum@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came true .
I hate people who have feelings .
have a nice weekend !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; sto@@ ri@@ es . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all geni@@ uses are eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers , but all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers are geni@@ uses . the set of all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers is th@@ us an , un@@ fortun@@ ately pro@@ per , sub@@ set of all geni@@ uses .
I don &apos;t think anyone thinks you &apos;re crazy .
Tom igno@@ red our advice .
we will be done in at most an hour .
I see her laugh@@ ing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her c@@ leav@@ age .
we &apos;re finished already .
we &apos;re un@@ rel@@ ated .
it &apos;s mis@@ lea@@ ding .
the only one who can solve this problem is you .
what a beautiful rain@@ bo@@ w !
you &apos;re a nervous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at kee@@ ping secrets ?
try hard to hold it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
you don &apos;t sound enti@@ r@@ ely con@@ vin@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
it &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the s@@ cen@@ e of the cri@@ me .
it makes no fu@@ c@@ king sense .
his eyes were sm@@ il@@ ing behind his glasses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the pres@@ ident &apos;s new secre@@ t@@ ary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .

it &apos;s not supposed to happen .
he hit me twice .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never gotten a spe@@ e@@ ding ticket .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish lea@@ ped out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than time .
are there any bag@@ s in this shop ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very ru@@ de .
he &apos;s pain@@ ting his house .
Tom looks like a fore@@ igner .
I had two copi@@ es of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go do@@ w@@ n@@ town .
tell me what you did on your ho@@ li@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicycle .
I &apos;ve learned so much from my mist@@ akes , I &apos;m thinking of making a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes s@@ low .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ vers@@ ity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will snow tomorrow .
you &apos;re too n@@ ai@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ic@@ k and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re as@@ ham@@ ed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for mon@@ ths .
what year were you born ?
please dro@@ p in when you happen to be in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
he is e@@ ager to please .
I didn &apos;t catch your last name .
we &apos;re both w@@ it@@ n@@ esses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a bat@@ h .
you don &apos;t have per@@ mission to do that .
I don &apos;t need any rest .
all took part in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the patient was dis@@ char@@ g@@ ed from hospital .
do you think Tom can re@@ turn ?
I have no money to buy the dictionary .
Sami re@@ f@@ used to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been studying music in Boston before I re@@ turned to Japan .
she vis@@ ited the old man in the hospital every day but Sun@@ day .
she came to Japan for the pu@@ r@@ pose of studying Japanese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ c@@ ted and im@@ pre@@ gn@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ and@@ ed their fl@@ ying s@@ auc@@ er in my b@@ ack@@ y@@ ard .
why did God cre@@ ate the uni@@ verse ?
p@@ ass me the sugar , please .
that was cool .
is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
there was a heavy rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I men@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having dou@@ b@@ ts .
they like English .
listen to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wo@@ re a red bl@@ ouse .
I stayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the town was full of acti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no intention of doing so .
the Earth and S@@ un are just tin@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I sugg@@ est we go out for a drink .
maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
do you reco@@ gni@@ ze the man in this photo ?
I want to join your team .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a caf@@ et@@ er@@ ia in the univers@@ ity .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tra bed .
you should take care of your@@ sel@@ ves .
be kind to little anim@@ als .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ lowing down my computer .
my computer cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the des@@ ire for le@@ i@@ sure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other urg@@ es , le@@ i@@ sure w@@ ins .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the mountain . are you really already ex@@ hau@@ sted ?
few students can read L@@ ati@@ n .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I fin@@ ally found a use for this old thing .
I want to war@@ m myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I admire your det@@ ermin@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can per@@ su@@ ade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay single .
I &apos;m looking forward to summer vacation .
I made a po@@ t ro@@ ast .
is she still single ?
she is not as beautiful as her older sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ es@@ us .
don &apos;t do@@ dge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ cks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en eg@@ gs .
you mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood me .
I don &apos;t know either of his bro@@ th@@ ers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will hold tal@@ ks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to prot@@ ect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the we@@ d@@ ding be hel@@ d ? &quot;
only a mi@@ rac@@ le may get him out of it .
can I see your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ ense ?
this should solve all your problems .
the man reading a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
did you have any lu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ anger here .
someone thre@@ w a rock at him .
he kis@@ sed me on the fore@@ head .
Mar@@ ia didn &apos;t susp@@ ect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her pen @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been correspon@@ ding for mon@@ ths over the Internet and wh@@ om she secre@@ tly loved , without ever having met him , was actually a super @-@ intelligent squ@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ d@@ om b@@ ites un@@ less it is att@@ acked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom main@@ t@@ ain@@ ed that he was innocent .
he is a man who is fon@@ d of cer@@ em@@ on@@ y .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big mou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of dogs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is ordin@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look p@@ ale as a g@@ ho@@ st .
catch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the kids ?
ph@@ ilo@@ so@@ ph@@ y is often regar@@ ded as difficult .
the radio doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consider the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not expect him to finish the t@@ ask in so short a time .
the space b@@ ar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ meric@@ al key@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s key .
that job is impossible for me to do .
there is much sugar in this black box .
our mother had no choice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
these two l@@ ines cut acro@@ ss each other at right ang@@ les .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dres@@ ses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s smart , hand@@ some and poli@@ te .
don &apos;t put all your eg@@ gs in one bas@@ ket .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in New York , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to apologi@@ ze for the way I ac@@ ted last night .
may you be tou@@ ched by H@@ is No@@ o@@ dly Ap@@ pend@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she almost fai@@ n@@ ted .
how much is the ex@@ pr@@ ess ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only then did I realize what he me@@ ant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lo@@ ts of ph@@ ones .
keep your eye on the ball .
I bur@@ ned my hand with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s impossible .
we love our mother almost without kno@@ wing it , without feeling it , as it is as natur@@ al as to live .
it scar@@ ed me .
when I &apos;m hot , a glass of cool water really re@@ fr@@ es@@ h@@ es me .
can you tell me where the ne@@ ar@@ est bus stop is ?
the st@@ ew sm@@ el@@ ls del@@ ici@@ ous .
Tom tal@@ ks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; why is your room p@@ in@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m loved .
you still haven &apos;t finished pay@@ ing for your was@@ hing ma@@ ch@@ ine ?
there is a rock in my sho@@ e .
this dog will prot@@ ect us .
Tom is a di@@ ve mas@@ ter .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
can I go to bed now ?
I can teach you something .
it &apos;s un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ able to date such a broken man , dar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side du@@ ring this pain@@ ful or@@ deal .
look at this m@@ ess .
he is anything but a reli@@ able man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
sugar is solu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
it &apos;s not enough to mem@@ ori@@ ze the for@@ mul@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you expect to happen ?
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is flu@@ ent in German , but with a s@@ light Americ@@ an acc@@ ent .
she always exp@@ ec@@ ts me to help her .
go and speak to my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue .
I do want to see you .
he was s@@ l@@ ain in b@@ att@@ le .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to bl@@ ame you .
I like cats .
why don &apos;t you use a ham@@ mer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I re@@ ach@@ ed the h@@ ill@@ top exactly at five .
it was tru@@ ly a mi@@ rac@@ le .
what &apos;s your fin@@ al destin@@ ation ?
once u@@ po@@ n a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
what are you going to do tonight ?
a boo@@ k@@ kee@@ per com@@ pu@@ tes all the company &apos;s in@@ come and ex@@ penses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bo@@ ther anymore .
he has a video .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wonder@@ ing .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can re@@ comm@@ end this restaurant .
the emplo@@ y@@ ee was es@@ cor@@ ted off the pre@@ mis@@ es .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
K@@ ate has been given an op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to play a ma@@ j@@ or ro@@ le in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
show us the str@@ ai@@ ght p@@ ath .
he did what I told him to do .
can you go to the office by train ?
the teacher was dis@@ appointed at my answer .
we ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated a house .
who t@@ au@@ ght you French ?
you &apos;re the pre@@ t@@ ti@@ est woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
get out of bed .
they ru@@ ined it .
he works under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .
there are many par@@ ks in our town .
you must teach me , one of these days .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
tell Tom what you mean .
un@@ fortun@@ ately , I already have pl@@ ans for that day .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
the whole city was dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated by water .
I have pl@@ enty of friends .
excuse me , but I think this is my se@@ at .
this is an op@@ ti@@ cal ill@@ us@@ ion .
let &apos;s mo@@ ve !
it was a gam@@ ble .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
my wife often r@@ ings me up , while she trav@@ els abroad .
why does Tom have a gun ?
you tou@@ ched my heart .
they got to be good friends .
excuse me sir , could you tell me where the place of the cin@@ em@@ a lo@@ c@@ ated ?
what are you watching ?
what has he done to you ?
ignore him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a drunk l@@ ying on the road .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is be@@ coming more and more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
every day you should at least listen to a short s@@ ong , read a good po@@ e@@ m , look at a beautiful picture , and , if possible , say s@@ ever@@ al intelligent words .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my living somewhere else .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was famous for its h@@ ang@@ ing gard@@ ens .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the en@@ em@@ y dro@@ pped many b@@ om@@ b@@ s on the fac@@ t@@ ory .
I &apos;m here all the time .
did you understand any of that ?
I have no words .
don &apos;t forget to answer his letter .
don &apos;t forget to bring k@@ it@@ ch@@ en u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils such as kni@@ ves and co@@ o@@ king po@@ ts .
no , that &apos;s not true . Tom didn &apos;t change his name . it &apos;s just a rum@@ our .
you dead .
it was a close game .
whose is the dictionary on the table ?
just be@@ have your@@ sel@@ ves .
after lunch we have two more cl@@ asses .
she &apos;s b@@ right and arti@@ cu@@ late .
I &apos;ve never been to a profes@@ si@@ on@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all game .
we got al@@ ong fam@@ ously .
the cap@@ ital of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il is B@@ ras@@ ili@@ a .
where did you go ?
he decided to have the oper@@ ation .
N@@ a@@ om@@ i has just finished her work .
he married my cous@@ in .
I had a hard time trying to per@@ su@@ ade him to canc@@ el the trip .
she is very sh@@ y and feel@@ s ill at ea@@ se at parti@@ es .
I feel bless@@ ed .
in the late 20@@ th cen@@ tu@@ ry , Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ lav@@ ia was consi@@ dered a ro@@ gue st@@ ate by the Un@@ ited St@@ ates .
that &apos;s what I &apos;d want .
hand me the ham@@ mer .
kids do stupid things .
you &apos;re very intelligent .
it &apos;s all ne@@ go@@ ti@@ able .
she tou@@ ched my sh@@ oul@@ der .
she went there yesterday .
there &apos;s a lot of traffic today .
your face is always di@@ r@@ ty .
it happened here .
I &apos;ll fi@@ x a drink .
I &apos;d be dis@@ appointed if I saw you doing that .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
if we had known that , we would &apos;ve come sooner .
I can &apos;t be mani@@ pul@@ ated .
what do you think of his sugg@@ es@@ tion ?
open those do@@ ors !
didn &apos;t you read the manu@@ al ?
he wants a play@@ m@@ ate .
she sp@@ ends all of her money on clothes .
Dan &apos;s message was in@@ sul@@ ting .
we wouldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
this hat is mine .
the first photos of the Earth taken from ou@@ ter space cap@@ tu@@ red the imagin@@ ation of an enti@@ re gener@@ ation .
pic@@ k@@ po@@ ck@@ ets tar@@ get tou@@ ri@@ sts .
I know you did this .
that looks like the work of a vir@@ us .
fuck your m@@ om , b@@ it@@ ch .
he who is not satis@@ fied with a little , is satis@@ fied with nothing .
why don &apos;t you try a different t@@ ack ?
I have been wan@@ ting to ask you a question .
why not just kno@@ ck on the door ?
in France , where the site was f@@ oun@@ ded , Tatoeba has become a cul@@ tur@@ al and soci@@ al ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
I speak K@@ ur@@ man@@ j@@ i .
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark .
I slept all day .
it &apos;s a mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent view , isn &apos;t it ?
a small lu@@ m@@ p of sugar , please .
what does this have to do with me ?
she has good sense .
he works in a b@@ ank .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
do you remember what you were watching ?
keep your hands up .
how fast !
I left it un@@ lo@@ cked .
go sit in the car .
when I g@@ row up I want to be just like you .
it &apos;s nice to live in this country .
it was not easy for us to find his house .
he is a lo@@ v@@ able person .
&quot; do you have a n@@ ick@@ name ? &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s R@@ ic@@ k . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t speak my language .
don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere in others &apos; affai@@ rs .
you can fo@@ ol all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fo@@ ol all the people all the time .
the pres@@ sure is building .
close the fu@@ c@@ king door !
he is interested in music .
reading books is my ho@@ b@@ by .
I like my st@@ ea@@ k r@@ are .
I never thought I &apos;d get that lucky .
Tom speaks French very flu@@ ently .
un@@ fortun@@ ately , that hasn &apos;t been possible .
I thought he would come .
I want this one myself .
it &apos;ll cost around thirty dollars .
he can &apos;t read it .
my sister &apos;s gu@@ it@@ ar is new .
Tom was lucky .
the little kids were very curi@@ ous .
C@@ ap@@ itu@@ late !
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
these shoes are too big for me .
what &apos;s the other condi@@ tion ?
you know nothing of the world .
what do you think about this plan ?
I will .
I ad@@ mit that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have a problem ?
the play@@ ers on this team are all gi@@ ants .
this one is the wor@@ st .
I was on the bus .
Tom has a secret wea@@ po@@ n .
you won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed .
it was so still that you would have heard a p@@ in dro@@ p .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
see you tomorrow !
he would be very glad to hear the news .
Dan sp@@ ent the night having se@@ x with Lin@@ da .
don &apos;t use your real name .
this book is really small !
K@@ o@@ al@@ as are cute .
I &apos;m never happ@@ ier than when I &apos;m by myself .
must I leave at once ?
a book worth reading is worth reading twice .
was anybody hurt ?
it &apos;s double plea@@ sure to dec@@ ei@@ ve the dec@@ ei@@ ver .
all you have to do is talk .
he can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an , too .
get the fuck out !
he enjo@@ ys good health .
all the sw@@ e@@ et talk was just a ru@@ se to get her into bed .
Mi@@ h@@ o plays piano better than N@@ ori@@ ko .
it me@@ ans that he likes you .
I knew it would happen sooner or later .
Tom is real cute .
they made me go there .
I don &apos;t know how to sp@@ ell that word .
is this all yours ?
Dan tou@@ ted his rac@@ ist ide@@ as to his friends .
I don &apos;t like cold weather , but Tom does .
the cap@@ tain invited her for breakfast .
I live here alone .
did you guys ho@@ ok up ?
there &apos;s really nothing more we can do .
I can &apos;t for@@ give him for be@@ having like that .
what would you do ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody help him .
Mary sin@@ gs best of all of the girls in class .
does anyone know what this is ?
you speak good French !
do you want help with that ?
I can &apos;t do it alone . you have to help me .
I &apos;m talking n@@ on@@ sense .
you don &apos;t seem to realize how seri@@ ous this is .
Tom won &apos;t bo@@ ther you anymore .
why did you come here today ?
that &apos;s more rec@@ ent than you think it is .
how can I u@@ plo@@ ad a photo to your we@@ b@@ site ?
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me .
Tom has bro@@ wn hair .
they lo@@ ad@@ ed the tru@@ ck .
it was cro@@ w@@ ded here all last week .
the A@@ T@@ M has sw@@ allowed my de@@ bit card .
did you st@@ eal that car ?
my grand@@ father was born in 19@@ 2@@ 0 .
Oh ! is it true ?
our first date was kind of aw@@ k@@ ward . I was really nervous .
I have to write a letter . do you have some paper ?
women usually live longer than men .
I didn &apos;t understand .
he couldn &apos;t go out because of the snow .
the first b@@ low is half the b@@ att@@ le .
how old was Tom when he started talking ?
I wear glasses only for reading .
I &apos;ll get ri@@ d of them .
the ver@@ dic@@ t was a b@@ it@@ ter p@@ ill to sw@@ al@@ low .
he stu@@ died very hard .
S@@ h@@ in@@ ob@@ u is really per@@ sist@@ ent . it seems that I am be@@ at@@ en .
today , there isn &apos;t any sal@@ ad , but only a large por@@ tion of fr@@ en@@ ch fri@@ es .
some s@@ n@@ akes are pois@@ on@@ ous .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to touch him .
I &apos;m broke and tired .
I usually take a sho@@ wer after I play tennis , but today I couldn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve been a big help .
everybody is sleeping .
I haven &apos;t seen him l@@ ately .
three years ago today , Tom and I got married .
I read somewhere that anim@@ als can sense an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake before it h@@ its .
J@@ im@@ my in@@ sist@@ ed that I take him to the zoo .
the prin@@ ce succ@@ ee@@ ded to the th@@ r@@ one .
it &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen any dr@@ ag@@ on@@ f@@ lies in this ar@@ ea .
Tom wants to say yes , but he can &apos;t .
you must listen .
he was be@@ at@@ en too easily .
they slept in the same bed .
I &apos;ve never seen you so happy .
you &apos;re not the only one .
come on , answer quickly .
she usually gets up early .
we are Australi@@ an .
could you let him out ?
my uncle is in his for@@ ties .
nobody can hear you .
don &apos;t bl@@ ame me for this .
watch your back .
I want to apologi@@ ze to you for call@@ ing you a j@@ er@@ k in front of your girlfriend .
no , I don &apos;t remember . I wasn &apos;t born yet .
they were we@@ al@@ thy .
which mus@@ eu@@ m would you like to visit first ?
you enjoy that , don &apos;t you ?
there is no s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
what ru@@ de language he uses !
I have my own reas@@ ons .
Spanish is spoken in a whole b@@ un@@ ch of coun@@ tri@@ es .
I fin@@ ally found time to sit down and read the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper .
I &apos;ll bet you can &apos;t guess what happened to me today .
do you know when he &apos;ll come back ?
would you mind if I kis@@ sed you ?
in English there are some words bor@@ ro@@ wed from Japanese .
Sami will spend life behind bar@@ s .
we &apos;re going to keep doing this until someone tel@@ ls us that we can &apos;t .
how could you say something like that ?
B@@ am@@ ak@@ o is M@@ al@@ i &apos;s cap@@ ital .
the P@@ res@@ ident of France will visit Japan next month .
she came late as usual .
let &apos;s be friends .
you were young .
have you been told when you are exp@@ ected to be here ?
I &apos;ll come back .
we &apos;re leaving now .
a wi@@ do@@ w had two daugh@@ ters .
I love flowers .
we sometimes meet them .
come here and help me .
my de@@ ed is my re@@ fu@@ ge .
do you appro@@ ve of what he is doing ?
your dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ ense has ex@@ pi@@ red .
it is not you but her that he wants to marry .
no one knows where he lives .
I like to fish in the river .
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus .
I &apos;m ready to fi@@ ght .
it &apos;s sometimes necessary not to tell the truth .
what on earth is an inter@@ ro@@ ban@@ g โฝ
you &apos;re not bad looking either .
what is wrong with him ?
it &apos;s not his sty@@ le .
she &apos;s quite a hand@@ ful .
that store sel@@ ls me@@ at and fish .
I appreciate what you did for me .
Tom gre@@ w up in a small f@@ is@@ hing village .
one more st@@ ep , and you &apos;ll be a dead man .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays many people travel by car .
come on , tell her !
I thought you were a friend .
are you fall@@ ing in love with me ?
he is afraid of the dog .
your fri@@ es are getting cold .
clear off the table .
we know you &apos;re interested .
who will pay ?
I &apos;m about the same age as you .
he &apos;s sleeping off last night &apos;s b@@ end@@ er .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the differ@@ ence between lin@@ en and wo@@ ol .
people can easily start lo@@ ving , but not so easily stop .
N@@ ar@@ a is a city which I like very much .
we made a good team .
there weren &apos;t many boys at the pic@@ ni@@ c .
he speaks broken French .
I &apos;m in love .
he met his wife on@@ line .
I no longer remember him .
this is a secret .
there was a cur@@ tain which was co@@ ver@@ ing the door .
there is no dou@@ b@@ t .
if I could I would immediately stop .
thank you for stop@@ ping by .
miss Smith is liked by all students .
you are rap@@ aci@@ ous .
close the b@@ loo@@ dy door .
is there any sal@@ t left ?
the profes@@ so@@ r se@@ em@@ ed to be lost in thought .
is that right ?
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
I slept the rest of the day .
you don &apos;t want to do this .
I &apos;m glad to be the one who tel@@ ls you .
this is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
how we@@ ir@@ d is that ?
please play something by C@@ ho@@ p@@ in for me .
she left France for Americ@@ a .
no one knows the fact .
I &apos;m 1@@ 7 , too .
we &apos;ll start again in the morning .
there &apos;s no shor@@ t@@ age of work around here .
you can &apos;t win them all .
have you ever played bas@@ eb@@ all ?
it is not easy to be understood by everybody .
I &apos;ll hurry .
no one can stop me from going there .
they have one too .
why is she sul@@ king ?
my au@@ n@@ t tre@@ ats me as if I were a child .
she fai@@ led and felt hu@@ mili@@ ated .
we should do better .
I think he will come to our party .
P@@ y@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as &apos; the@@ o@@ re@@ m al@@ lo@@ ws you to cal@@ cu@@ late the l@@ eng@@ th of the hy@@ po@@ ten@@ use of a right tri@@ ang@@ le .
I just need to know what happened .
he ro@@ b@@ bed an old l@@ ad@@ y .
who &apos;s to say which is better ?
I don &apos;t take it pers@@ on@@ ally .
I went to wash my hands .
you are talking .
why would you want to do that ?
Tom bo@@ il@@ ed some water .
you &apos;re up@@ set .
my heart s@@ ank .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
I anti@@ cip@@ ated trouble .
life is very short .
language , as we know it , is a hu@@ man in@@ ven@@ tion .
that is a p@@ ag@@ o@@ da .
is this going to cause us any problems ?
the rain was driving in our fac@@ es .
I &apos;ll give them to you as a rough gu@@ ide .
my stom@@ ach started gro@@ w@@ ling right there in the meeting . it was embarrass@@ ing .
he wrote down her name in the no@@ te@@ book .
I got here a little early today .
Tom has in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed the po@@ wer of his bike .
how many mo@@ s@@ ques are there in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l ?
I &apos;ll spend Christmas with my family .
does this hurt ?
she doesn &apos;t speak much .
she knew too much .
he ex@@ cel@@ s all his bro@@ th@@ ers in scho@@ l@@ as@@ tic abili@@ ty .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
the doctor attend@@ ed to the sick old man all night , pour@@ ing shot after shot of wh@@ is@@ key into the old man &apos;s open mou@@ th until he died .
Tom shouldn &apos;t be pun@@ ished ; he didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you &apos;ve got to learn to be careful .
&quot; thank you . &quot; &quot; you &apos;re wel@@ come . &quot;
you mis@@ sed the meeting .
I left the keys in the ig@@ ni@@ tion .
where is the toil@@ et ?
can I buy only the l@@ en@@ ses ?
it &apos;s one thing to speak a language ; tea@@ ching it is a whole new ball game .

we all have a tend@@ enc@@ y to think that the world must con@@ for@@ m to our pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ces . the op@@ pos@@ ite view invol@@ ves some effor@@ t of thought , and most people would die sooner than think - in fact they do so .
this isn &apos;t supposed to be happen@@ ing .
who disco@@ ver@@ ed radi@@ um ?
I know Tom is done .
I believe this man is lost .
Tom fell in love with the char@@ ac@@ ters in his nov@@ el .
I &apos;d like to find out what this is .

Tom and Mary don &apos;t really have much in com@@ mon .

I was about to leave my house when she called .
don &apos;t you know who that is ?
she wat@@ ched him swim .
I de@@ e@@ ply regre@@ t having caus@@ ed the accident .
she takes after her mother in every respect .
I don &apos;t know whether you like her or not .

I &apos;m not an idiot .
I think we need a doctor .
it &apos;s not a question of good or bad but of better or worse .

I had enough sense to get out of there .
do you feel gu@@ il@@ ty ?
I &apos;ll talk .
your face is red .
it doesn &apos;t matter , right ?
Tom isn &apos;t a student .
we have no choice but to carry on .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I don &apos;t mind even if she doesn &apos;t come .
the dog is cr@@ un@@ ching a b@@ one .

he was afraid that he might hurt her feelings .

may I ask you to do me a fav@@ or ?
it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t cro@@ s@@ sed my mind .
Tom didn &apos;t look very well .
I &apos;m not married .
I &apos;d heard you &apos;d changed .
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend .
today we must do what everyone else will do tomorrow .
Tom knows he will be pun@@ ished .
did you visit the T@@ o@@ wer of L@@ on@@ don ?
the ann@@ oun@@ cer spoke English .
I &apos;ve tried .
there were no problems .
how can you be so cru@@ el ?
I &apos;ll keep it for her .
there &apos;s nothing as pre@@ ci@@ ous as love .
I &apos;d like to make a speech .
I had no al@@ tern@@ ative .
maybe we should start .
Ah , that &apos;s life !
both vic@@ t@@ ory and de@@ fe@@ at are but an every@@ day occu@@ r@@ ren@@ ce to a sol@@ di@@ er .
did you find what you were looking for ?
he thinks I &apos;m je@@ al@@ ous .
there were no cu@@ stom@@ ers , so we closed the shop early .
she likes being looked at by boys .
have you worked the pu@@ zz@@ le out ?
we don &apos;t always agree .
he den@@ i@@ ed having said such a thing .
you know I hate that .
R@@ u@@ g@@ by is an out@@ door game .
there is more plea@@ sure in lo@@ ving than in being loved .
Mary w@@ ears a spor@@ ts br@@ a for exerci@@ se .
is Tom a w@@ it@@ ness ?
you &apos;ll get another chance .

the fre@@ ight train was hel@@ d up about half an hour because of a den@@ se fo@@ g .
Tom knows that won &apos;t work .
I &apos;m fl@@ ab@@ by .
may I ask you something ?
does Tom like Mary ?

I wear a suit , but not a ti@@ e .
we will emplo@@ y a man who can speak English .
the baby is sleeping .
he asked questions at r@@ and@@ om .
that &apos;s too hard .
tell Tom what Mary told you .
I can &apos;t tell you what an hon@@ or this is .
Tom dr@@ ank a glass of water .
he took the wo@@ od and sa@@ wed it using the saw .
B@@ ig@@ am@@ y is when you have one wife too many .

B@@ ur@@ ma is called &quot; M@@ y@@ an@@ m@@ ar &quot; in B@@ ur@@ m@@ ese .
I &apos;d like to try it on .

do you have a pen I could use ?
what Mary did did not please me .
there are a few y@@ ach@@ ts on the cal@@ m sea .
go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e !
my fai@@ th in the next gener@@ ation is in@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
how do we find out what we need to know ?
but go@@ dd@@ am@@ mit where did I put those re@@ char@@ g@@ ea@@ ble bat@@ ter@@ ies ?
I met Tom when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
I don &apos;t have any choice .
most Al@@ ger@@ i@@ ans are I@@ s@@ lam@@ i@@ sts , some show it but others will hi@@ de it .
I am hungry because I did not have breakfast .
he will do his best to finish it on time .
we don &apos;t care what he does .
now I &apos;m wi@@ de aw@@ ake .
we must re@@ fl@@ ect on our fai@@ lu@@ re .
who is your fav@@ ou@@ rite Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ ber ?
his dog appe@@ ar@@ ed su@@ d@@ den@@ ly from behind the door .
I can &apos;t get al@@ ong with him .
my d@@ ad &apos;s name is Fri@@ t@@ z .
it &apos;s OK with me .
it didn &apos;t work for me either .
they saw us yesterday .
F@@ red took a li@@ king to Jane and they started seeing each other .
Tom makes del@@ ici@@ ous co@@ ok@@ ies .
I &apos;d like to use a safe .
it could just be your imagin@@ ation .
and it l@@ as@@ ted until early morning .
who could bl@@ ame him ?
he wi@@ g@@ gl@@ ed his to@@ es .
I found the love of my life .
do you want to sit next to the window ?
that was probably what in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed their dec@@ ision .
the Ger@@ m@@ ans have won again .
are there any other op@@ tions ?
you don &apos;t know that .
they do it fas@@ ter than me .
bi@@ te your ton@@ gue .
I can &apos;t promise you anything .
we won &apos;t have enough time to do that before Tom gets here .
Tom to@@ s@@ sed another lo@@ g on the fire .

Tom asked Mary to sw@@ ee@@ p the floor .
speaking about love is making love .
they will agree on that .
you &apos;re dis@@ lo@@ y@@ al .
I don &apos;t know what your problem is .
what &apos;s your e @-@ mai@@ l address ?
Tom has what it takes to be a good teacher .
she is very fon@@ d of writing po@@ ems .
I hope that you aren &apos;t afraid .
I lent Tom my cam@@ era .
am I the only one ?
would you like to come ?
Tom is poor , but he &apos;s happy .
our car is being re@@ pai@@ red at the au@@ to shop .
there was a par@@ ade to mar@@ k the occasion .
who sent you ?
my son isn &apos;t the only one who enjo@@ ys eating her co@@ o@@ king .
I just need to be alone .
have you any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
they &apos;re too fat .
I know that he &apos;s reading .
Tom died a few days later .
I won &apos;t come tomorrow .
I just don &apos;t want to believe it .
the station is three k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ ers away from here .
don &apos;t ask questions , just come with me .
don &apos;t br@@ ake su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
I won &apos;t be coming until four o &apos;clock .
I bought this hat when I was in Boston .
I agree with everything you just said .

that is not what I me@@ ant to say .
you &apos;re fi@@ red .
Tom can swim no more than a st@@ one can .
do we need a P@@ l@@ an B ?
is there something I can do for you ?
I think Tom has been very lucky .
he gave the impres@@ sion of having much money .
it &apos;s st@@ able because all the ro@@ o@@ ts of this e@@ qu@@ ation are ne@@ g@@ ative .
could you please fi@@ x this ?
we speak English in class .
happy birthday !
well , it &apos;s time for me to run off . B@@ y@@ e !

when I see this picture , I &apos;m re@@ min@@ ded of our ho@@ li@@ day .
we are living in the at@@ om@@ ic age .
I cannot appro@@ ve the pro@@ ject .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t think that .
you &apos;re leaving already ?
the police caught the th@@ i@@ ef .
C@@ entr@@ al Par@@ k is near where I work .
I don &apos;t need a lo@@ an anymore .
I think that he &apos;s probably not a bad boy .
I fin@@ ally found out what was wrong with my TV .
we &apos;ve all done things we &apos;re as@@ ham@@ ed of .
it took a long time to bring him around to our point of view .

she met the man of her dre@@ am@@ s .

Tom took early reti@@ rement on health gr@@ ounds .
I d@@ un@@ no if it &apos;s a bu@@ g or what , but this sof@@ tw@@ are doesn &apos;t work right .
it p@@ ains me to dis@@ agree with your opinion .
don &apos;t you have any will po@@ wer ?
sleep is no less necessary to health than food .
it &apos;s more interesting to travel alone than to go on a grou@@ p tour .

he has seen better days .
he told me all the det@@ ails .
he is cu@@ tt@@ ing down tre@@ es on a mountain .
get out of here ! all of you !
how can you be sure of that ?
Tom du@@ cked Mary &apos;s pun@@ ch .
I know what you were doing .
this medic@@ ine does not have side effec@@ ts .
I don &apos;t think you can be@@ at me .
I am call@@ ing back my wife .
I almost believe you .
seeing that you &apos;re not surprised , I think you must have known .
I &apos;m a bit ho@@ ar@@ se .
could I do it ?
this book has a lot of pic@@ tures .
we took an exam@@ in@@ ation in mat@@ h last week .
Mary hel@@ ped her mother cook .

I am looking forward to your letter .
we must try to prot@@ ect the envir@@ on@@ ment .
you think I &apos;m scar@@ ed , don &apos;t you ?
he closed his eyes .
at home everything is early , both tal@@ ent and bal@@ d@@ ness .
I have no real choice .
it made me think .
H@@ i@@ k@@ ers need to carry a comp@@ ass with them to find their way through the wo@@ ods .
take a tis@@ su@@ e , your no@@ se is running .
I &apos;m looking forward to Christmas .
I hate black hu@@ mo@@ r .
before talking with Tom , Mary ar@@ m@@ ed herself with courage .
I told her to come visit us .
a boy ran up to me .
it looks nice with your trou@@ ser@@ s .
yesterday I was cl@@ ever and tried to change the world , and today I have become wi@@ se and started with myself .
you &apos;re not very fun@@ ny .
Tom was very angry with me .
don &apos;t you see who &apos;s fol@@ lowing us ?
with anim@@ als I wish to live my life ; they &apos;re such great comp@@ an@@ ions !
how did they find out ?

&quot; may I speak to Mr N@@ ak@@ ag@@ aw@@ a ? &quot; &quot; speaking . &quot;

C@@ op@@ y this pro@@ gr@@ am on your computer .
I haven &apos;t had time to thank you pro@@ per@@ ly .
my wife is co@@ o@@ king right now .
I hate to wait .
fran@@ k@@ ly speaking , I don &apos;t think you have what it takes to become a teacher .
Tom wants everyone to get out of here .
the snow m@@ el@@ ted away when spring came .
I have no idea who he is .
I am h@@ ers and she is mine .
are you sure about the cost of that car ?
I respect my English teacher , M@@ r@@ . T@@ an@@ i@@ gu@@ ch@@ i .
are you sure you don &apos;t want something to eat ?
that &apos;s pretty much all you need to know .

I &apos;ve got a good idea .
no single speech can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate years of mis@@ trust , no@@ r can I answer in the time that I have all the comple@@ x questions that br@@ ought us to this point .
we all have different str@@ eng@@ ths .
I like to cook all kin@@ ds of food .

I needed time to con@@ vin@@ ce her .
you &apos;ve turned up at the right moment .
I don &apos;t like cold coffee .

you &apos;re not fat .
this is a good plan .
tell me why you were absent from school yesterday .
everyone &apos;s there .
they &apos;ve changed a lot .
talking to Tom isn &apos;t going to help .
you have the adv@@ antage of a good e@@ du@@ c@@ ation .
Tom does what he wants to .
no one fol@@ lowed us .
what cri@@ ter@@ ion did you use when you el@@ ected this ess@@ ay as the win@@ ner ?

Sami hasn &apos;t even finished reading one p@@ age .

in gam@@ es of chance , it &apos;s very important to know the probab@@ ili@@ ties of ev@@ ents .
does this b@@ ack@@ p@@ ack bel@@ ong to him ?
are you sure that it was Tom ?
my grand@@ father no longer has a dri@@ ver &apos;s lic@@ ense .

the mus@@ eu@@ m cur@@ at@@ or wanted the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ an pain@@ ting to be sand@@ wi@@ ched between two pi@@ ec@@ es of th@@ ic@@ k ac@@ r@@ y@@ li@@ c glass .

I &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re completely so@@ ld out .
that &apos;s no longer allowed .
they want me to organ@@ ize the party .
that &apos;s why I sent for you .
can you tell me about that con@@ vers@@ ation ?
her name was un@@ known .
why have you for@@ gotten the po@@ t@@ ato@@ es and not the beer ?
did you tell Tom he could b@@ orrow your car ?
there are some people who hate the idea of the Euro@@ pe@@ an C@@ omm@@ un@@ ity .
sometimes I smoke just to give my hands something to do .
you look a little sh@@ a@@ ken .
B@@ on voyage !
there are people here who need your help .

the floor is sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
the wh@@ ale is not a fish but a mam@@ mal .
what do you plan on doing with the money ?
it &apos;s already 2 : 30 and Tom isn &apos;t here yet .

it was sil@@ ly of him to re@@ fu@@ se her off@@ er .
the next station is where you get off .
take a break .
is there anything else you want to tell me ?
the ow@@ n@@ ers appointed him man@@ ager .
you almost gave me a heart att@@ ack .
it seems that something has happened .
do you have a bu@@ cket of water for me by any chance ? I have a fl@@ at ty@@ re .
I have never been to that town .
when did you come back from Ger@@ many ?
he mi@@ sto@@ ok me for my tw@@ in brother .

you don &apos;t have enough experience .
he made re@@ fer@@ ence to the pre@@ vi@@ ous direc@@ tor .
pleased to meet you .
I didn &apos;t know that you car@@ ed .
we can see a ch@@ ur@@ ch over there .
she &apos;s never said that , maybe you &apos;re mist@@ a@@ ken .
our interes@@ ts seem to conf@@ lic@@ t with each other .
do other plan@@ ets exist , on which life can exist ?
what &apos;s your favorite way to cook be@@ ans ?
my bad .

how did you learn to cook so well ?
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m ac@@ cu@@ stom@@ ed to working hard .
she doesn &apos;t even know that I exist .
he lives in En@@ gl@@ and .
I am not used to being spoken to in that ru@@ de way .
are you ready for Christmas ?
ex@@ pres@@ sions and sm@@ iles change like that just from ap@@ pl@@ ying rouge and li@@ p@@ sti@@ ck .
one father is more than a hun@@ d@@ red scho@@ ol@@ mas@@ ters .

I don &apos;t remember what it was about .
it &apos;s a sh@@ ame .
I &apos;m lu@@ sting after him .
how much does my de@@ b@@ t am@@ oun@@ t to ?
those who want hon@@ ey must not be afraid of be@@ es .
he is not at all a g@@ ent@@ l@@ eman .
as is often the case with her , she didn &apos;t show up on time .
don &apos;t you remember my name ?
I &apos;m still not satis@@ fied .
they ad@@ m@@ itted they were l@@ azy .
I &apos;m surprised that B@@ eth didn &apos;t enjoy her time at the f@@ ar@@ m .
you probably just want to be alone .
Tom wanted Mary to meet his friends .
he probably has a girlfriend already .
there are a lot of bri@@ d@@ ges in this city .
is there any@@ where you want to go ?
I got busy .
Tom is a go@@ l@@ d@@ sm@@ ith .
&quot; don &apos;t c@@ ry , &quot; she said .

the eye is sen@@ si@@ tive to light .
you should have been more careful .
you will get the wor@@ st be@@ ating of your life .
I &apos;m lon@@ ely without you .
we are ho@@ ping to visit S@@ pain this summer .
Tom hasn &apos;t said a word .
he used to read a lot .
is that understood ?
is it all right to eat out tonight ?
my parents sent me to fat cam@@ p when I was thir@@ te@@ en .
she seems to be interested in him .
how did you find me ?
the girl p@@ aus@@ ed and sm@@ il@@ ed ; the young man p@@ aus@@ ed and si@@ gh@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
they all came by bike .
you should not sleep .
living without ill@@ us@@ ions is the secret to happ@@ iness .
it was just as I thought .
take this to your mother .
don &apos;t forget to send that letter .
why are you so interested ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a dec@@ ent car .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
to tell the truth , I completely forgot .
have you gone crazy ?
she has never fall@@ en in love .
I was at the party .
this type of person is bor@@ ing .
B@@ y@@ e , S@@ ay@@ ok@@ o !
he lost a fortune in the sto@@ ck market .
sec@@ tion 9 of the En@@ danger@@ ed S@@ p@@ ec@@ ies A@@ c@@ t makes it il@@ le@@ g@@ al to take an end@@ anger@@ ed spec@@ ies of fish or w@@ il@@ d@@ life .
yes , that was am@@ az@@ ing . Un@@ believ@@ able !
what do you want to see while you &apos;re here ?
I wonder if anything happened to him .
I love all of you .
what &apos;s going on down there ?
it is pre@@ mat@@ ure to dis@@ cus@@ s it now .
no one knows her .
we often hear you sing .
he diff@@ ers from his brother .
when are you going home ?
they w@@ av@@ ed fl@@ ag@@ s to wel@@ come the prin@@ c@@ ess .
he was be@@ coming a famous sin@@ ger .
I qu@@ it smoking .
I know that you and Tom are friends .
we were att@@ acked by sw@@ ar@@ ms of be@@ es .
f@@ ear is a bad advis@@ er .
it &apos;s a very small price for such an important vic@@ t@@ ory .
Sami didn &apos;t want to be sh@@ am@@ ed in the village by his che@@ ating wife .
Tom isn &apos;t a min@@ or .
Tom took out a bag of mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
you know this isn &apos;t the way we should be doing this .
I gave the house to you .
what do you regre@@ t most ?
don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t war@@ n you .
the little girl , de@@ e@@ ply mo@@ ved by the old man &apos;s pi@@ ti@@ ful story , bur@@ st into tears .
it de@@ p@@ ends on how much money you have .
he wants to be a doctor in the future .
he likes taking wal@@ ks .

the route was blo@@ cked by a tree .
I often played tru@@ ant .
Tom has coll@@ ected a great many but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies .
now sh@@ ake hands and make up .
the S@@ un sm@@ il@@ ed through the window every morning .
I was in way over my head .
I have no parti@@ cul@@ ar tal@@ ent .
Tom knew this was going to happen .
guess what I found on the b@@ each .
I &apos;ve sp@@ ent a lot .
the girl who lives next door is very pretty .
we should have told him the truth .
they are out sho@@ p@@ ping .
Tom is det@@ ermin@@ ed to lose we@@ ight .
they are ac@@ t@@ ors .
I &apos;m looking for someone who can speak P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese .
some people say that the theory of ev@@ o@@ lution is &quot; only &quot; a theory but a scientifi@@ c theory is something that has been pro@@ ven to be true .
there &apos;s no so@@ ap .
I felt de@@ press@@ ed .
they sp@@ ent the afternoon around the po@@ ol .
I couldn &apos;t find it any@@ where .
can you show me ?
we &apos;ll take part in the mar@@ ath@@ on .
what &apos;s your di@@ agno@@ s@@ is ?
some@@ day the US@@ A will el@@ ect a woman pres@@ ident , and it won &apos;t be pretty .
if you tell Tom what to do , he &apos;ll do it .
this animal is mine .
it &apos;s A@@ pri@@ l first .
he will soon get used to the cli@@ m@@ ate here .
what kind of person am I ?
I admire your ignor@@ ance .
if I s@@ cre@@ w up , what &apos;s the wor@@ st that can happen ?
what you did to Tom was cru@@ el .
that rock band gives me a h@@ ea@@ d@@ ache .
I can &apos;t forget about that stupid movie .
who gives a fuck ?
no one could den@@ y this .
both he and I are high school students .
c@@ lear@@ ly , this is the most important point .
they &apos;re against animal ab@@ use .
can you sig@@ n this birthday card ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to stop al@@ lowing her to always have her own way .
you &apos;re lucky to have such a good job .
I agree with some of your opin@@ ions .
I was already married at your age .
as far as I am concer@@ ned , I have no objec@@ tion .
I just got ten@@ ure .
do you have any cas@@ h ?
you &apos;ll b@@ oun@@ ce back .
she &apos;s my wife .
my dog won &apos;t bi@@ te you , un@@ less you ask for it .
a trip to Mar@@ s may become possible in my li@@ fe@@ time .
I &apos;d tell you all you want and more , if the s@@ ounds I made could be what you hear .
take any two car@@ ds you like .
over 3@@ 00 people were ar@@ res@@ ted .
the heart and my@@ st@@ er@@ y of his ph@@ ilo@@ so@@ ph@@ y was , to look u@@ po@@ n the world as a gi@@ gan@@ tic practi@@ cal jo@@ ke ; as something too ab@@ sur@@ d to be consi@@ dered seri@@ ously , by any r@@ ation@@ al man .

you must exerci@@ se more care in writing English .
do you want something to eat ?
you can &apos;t buy that kind of lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
they look so cute together .
what can you teach me ?
that won &apos;t change anything .
we &apos;re done .
you need to re@@ dec@@ or@@ ate your room .
I &apos;m sure Tom will leave early .
I know you feel bad .
I have stayed in K@@ yo@@ to for three days .
be fai@@ r .
a gu@@ ide condu@@ c@@ ted the visit@@ ors r@@ ound the mus@@ eu@@ m .
this problem is difficult to solve .
how do you know that you don &apos;t need a bo@@ d@@ y@@ gu@@ ard ?
I couldn &apos;t b@@ ear to look at her .
the b@@ om@@ b will explo@@ de in 10 secon@@ ds .
that is his house .
smoking har@@ ms your health .
where are you going ?
your sister called .
they saw us as they were getting off the train .
he wants to squ@@ ish the bu@@ g .
I understand your feelings .
I didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
now and then your sister as@@ ks our sist@@ ers to teach her something .
I don &apos;t want my son to be like you .
R@@ e@@ peti@@ tion hel@@ ps you remember something .
when will your new nov@@ el come out ?
why did you agree to help them ?
why did you do that ?
she ex@@ plain@@ ed to him why she didn &apos;t like his parents .
Tom &apos;s here .
I hate go@@ at che@@ ese .
they are as strong as us .
I found the money .
she c@@ lear@@ ly wants to go .
you &apos;re w@@ im@@ ps !
what cr@@ ap ! your arrog@@ ant comm@@ ents aren &apos;t just us@@ el@@ ess but also a pain in the ar@@ se .
I am thinking about bu@@ ying a new par@@ as@@ ol .
I like list@@ ening to the go@@ l@@ d@@ fin@@ ches sin@@ ging .
how about for tomorrow ?
she can speak R@@ us@@ si@@ an .
I fol@@ lowed the reci@@ pe .
things are about to change .
stop del@@ u@@ ding yourself .
we like nobody and nobody likes us .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
be pre@@ pared .
I think that they will fol@@ low us .
I appreciate your sup@@ port .
Tom introdu@@ ced himself .
I am just war@@ ming up now .
he re@@ turned home for the first time in ten years .
does it bo@@ ther you if I smoke ?
she has a piano les@@ son once a week .
it goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health .
the train was del@@ ayed because of heavy s@@ no@@ w@@ fall .
I hate them all .
it is very fine today .
I owe you my life .
Mary is a better swim@@ mer than Jane .
are you really going to let Tom do that ?
he doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
fran@@ k@@ ly , I don &apos;t like your idea .
Tom must learn French .
Mary is thir@@ st@@ y .
no @-@ one invited her .
I know something you don &apos;t .
are we m@@ ad squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s ?
the st@@ abili@@ ty of Ch@@ in@@ ese e@@ conom@@ y is sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally over@@ esti@@ mat@@ ed .
I felt bad about what I did .
do you get it ?
may I ask you some more questions ?
this mo@@ vement from r@@ ur@@ al to ur@@ b@@ an ar@@ e@@ as has been going on for over two hun@@ d@@ red years .
send it to me .
you can &apos;t smoke here .
do you have a blo@@ g ?
I met her late in the evening .
when is the breakfast ser@@ ved ?
I &apos;m here with a friend .
do you want me to believe that ?
Tom was afraid of fai@@ lu@@ re .
I mess@@ ed up .
O@@ w !
she would have been very prou@@ d of you .
I &apos;ve been wal@@ king on cru@@ t@@ ches ever since I broke my fo@@ ot .
this idea has never en@@ tered my head before .
I don &apos;t understand any of this .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
the R@@ h@@ ine run@@ s between France and Ger@@ many .
they went to the public swimming po@@ ol .
I said that this was a meeting room , not a be@@ d@@ room !
the Earth is a big ball .
it &apos;s my turn to tell you a secret .
what are you doing , D@@ ad ?
you &apos;re living in the past .
where exactly did you go ?
why can &apos;t I see you ?
I kind of liked them .
I &apos;m glad to have this op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to speak to you .

he did a pretty good job .
then the do@@ ll &apos;s eyes began to sh@@ ine like two stars and it became ali@@ ve .
the det@@ ec@@ tive took down his t@@ esti@@ mon@@ y on the spo@@ t .

Tom is eas@@ y@@ going , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ standing .
I suppose you want to ask me where I &apos;ve been .
it was him that broke the window yesterday .
run as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
when were you thinking of coming back to the St@@ ates ?

the p@@ sy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist asked me a whole bat@@ ter@@ y of questions .

I know Tom is a good ac@@ tor .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
do you know how to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong ?

as he couldn &apos;t end@@ ure , he took to his he@@ els .
the ju@@ ry didn &apos;t buy Dan &apos;s story .
is anyone else going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already open .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ th@@ ers or sist@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the coffee is too strong for me . &quot; &quot; Oh , I am sorry . per@@ hap@@ s ad@@ d a little milk . &quot;
he made a speech in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my opinion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom hasn &apos;t reali@@ zed his mistake yet .

there was absolu@@ tel@@ y nothing you could do about it .
do you like hor@@ ro@@ r mo@@ vies ?
whose turn is it ?
do you have any advice for me ?
Jane is not as t@@ all as Mary .

I looked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the road .
I think that &apos;s the best answer .
what fo@@ ods , if any , do you avo@@ id eating ?

Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .

I knew I shouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom won &apos;t visit Boston .

S@@ ai@@ ling around the world would be an experience of a li@@ fe@@ time .
no deal was stru@@ ck .
I know you &apos;re busy , but can I talk to you for a minute ?
today &apos;s trouble is enough for today .
I can do it without her help .
he went in the op@@ pos@@ ite direction from us .
are you a cri@@ min@@ al ?
she was very ru@@ de to him .
the game is not worth the cand@@ le .
Tom looks at her without saying anything .
the sho@@ o@@ ting has stop@@ ped .

I had half a gr@@ ap@@ e@@ fruit for breakfast .
they bought quite a few books .
I really need to talk to you priv@@ ately .
what &apos;ve you done ?
Tom p@@ ushed Mary into doing that .
don &apos;t fuck with me !
I had to give Tom time to think about it .
this is why I hate him .
I &apos;d like to buy eye dro@@ ps .

I &apos;ve done that coun@@ t@@ less times .
you guys are aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
we know that you &apos;re sick .
I &apos;d take it if I were you .
did you go to the restaurant yesterday ?

put the car into the gar@@ age .
I expect you to be pun@@ ctu@@ al .
what was the first concert you went to ?
has Tom been fi@@ red ?
he mo@@ ves quickly .
the baby fell as@@ le@@ ep in the cr@@ ad@@ le .
we looked around the pro@@ per@@ ty .
I can hold my bre@@ ath for a long time .
that &apos;s another matter .
we haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
this is something I must face alone .
what do I mean to you ?
I sugg@@ est you co@@ oper@@ ate .
we were me@@ di@@ oc@@ re .

I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m talking to you about this .

Tom was mau@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .
we sw@@ am in the sea .
he slept until ten o &apos;clock .
the Earth is just a little is@@ land and we are little is@@ l@@ and@@ ers .
she is a good li@@ ar .
I am not busy .
why don &apos;t we all go ?
let me put this in per@@ spec@@ tive for you .

I love my y@@ el@@ low sw@@ e@@ ater .
you shall have a bicycle for your birthday .
she made it plain that she wanted to go to col@@ le@@ ge .
I was a sh@@ y child .
I suppose it makes sense to go a@@ head and pay the bill right now .
he is as@@ ham@@ ed to ask questions .
I can &apos;t turn it on , because the sw@@ it@@ ch is broken .
these clothes are di@@ r@@ ty and need to be was@@ hed .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll leave early .
they &apos;re reading a book .
Al@@ f@@ red , K@@ ing of En@@ gl@@ and , was a great scho@@ l@@ ar as well as a great ru@@ ler .
you need to sleep .
&quot; Oh ! they &apos;ll find him gu@@ il@@ ty , &quot; said the other . &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of that . &quot;
I am lost .
he is getting better .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
every@@ day life can get a bit mon@@ o@@ ton@@ ous at times .

where did you have your suit made ?
I am not certain about that .
while he was sick , he lost a lot of we@@ ight .
I &apos;ll bring wine .

have you already eaten sup@@ per ?
the sun is about to ri@@ se .
it is il@@ le@@ g@@ al to park a car there .
do you know how to read a ma@@ p ?
I thought I had until 2 : 30 .
I like mat@@ h least of all .
that has nothing to do with him .
we call him Mi@@ ke .
how did you get into our room ?
everybody had a hard time .
I &apos;d like some sugar , please .
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to wear glasses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay attention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
he is a true co@@ lo@@ s@@ sus .
I may know someone who can help you .
here we are .
the soci@@ ety in which they live is very different from our own .
she wrote a lot of po@@ ems .
I want to talk to you .
he was born in R@@ o@@ me .
how did you become invol@@ ved in this pro@@ ject ?
either you or I must go in his place .
with all his faul@@ ts , he is resp@@ ected by everybody .
what a tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy !
Tom har@@ dly ever w@@ ears a ti@@ e .
I pain@@ ted a picture for you .
he likes to talk about himself .
there was a kno@@ ck on the door .
how did you know that man was a co@@ p ?
how did you get into my house ?
I &apos;m not a great photo@@ gr@@ ap@@ her .
it &apos;s like one of those .
she s@@ cru@@ b@@ bed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en floor with a br@@ ush .
those do@@ ors should be closed .
what would you do in my place ?
I go to any party I am invited to .
there are four se@@ as@@ ons in a year - spring , summer , fall , and winter .
I want to help you get out of this m@@ ess .
Sami was already on the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter .

I must be leaving now .
she was appreci@@ ab@@ ly t@@ an@@ ned after her vacation .
the wo@@ od was very dark , and she could not help trembl@@ ing from f@@ ear .

I want Tom to take a look at that .
do you think he will like that ?
jus@@ tice in this country is a bit of a double stand@@ ard : there is the jus@@ tice of the poor and the jus@@ tice of the rich .
I don &apos;t eat out very often .
&quot; let &apos;s play H@@ o@@ p S@@ k@@ i@@ p An@@ d J@@ um@@ p like me , &quot; said the little wh@@ ite r@@ ab@@ bit .

we remember .
it is free of charge .
will he succ@@ e@@ ed or fai@@ l ?
I just don &apos;t like it .
Ju@@ d@@ ging from his appe@@ ar@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to apologi@@ ze to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have pl@@ enty of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m making an appoin@@ t@@ ment for my daughter .
he succ@@ ee@@ ded to his uncle &apos;s fortune .
Dan didn &apos;t know where his car key was .
I miss you all the time .
you are a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er .
will you go to the dance with me ?
it &apos;s expensive to mo@@ derni@@ ze a city .

they &apos;re not a thre@@ at .
Tom won &apos;t believe it .
that gu@@ y &apos;s a friend of mine .
Australi@@ a is about tw@@ enty times lar@@ ger than Japan .
she cut the cake in two .
you hand@@ led that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his succ@@ ess .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I suppose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to sit on the b@@ en@@ ch over there next to the stre@@ et lam@@ p .
An@@ tar@@ es is a red st@@ ar .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I have a friend in S@@ pain who speaks five languages .
is today your birthday ?
let &apos;s go to P@@ au@@ l &apos;s D@@ iner .
you ought to be quiet in a library .
Tom fell as@@ le@@ ep waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only sli@@ gh@@ tly sm@@ aller than the Earth and Mar@@ s is bi@@ g@@ ger than half of Earth .
do you find that was@@ hing ma@@ ch@@ ine easy to use ?
she comm@@ itted a cri@@ me .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ war@@ ds them .
it is easy to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish good from ev@@ il .
how is your d@@ ad ?
bring them to me .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak L@@ o@@ j@@ b@@ an .
Tom drin@@ ks at least three li@@ ters of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the th@@ r@@ ush sin@@ gs each s@@ ong twice over .
do you know if he is av@@ ai@@ l@@ able ? I need to know in order to make an appoin@@ t@@ ment with him .
don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ v@@ al on price .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Ch@@ in@@ ese .
have you been told the reas@@ ons why we didn &apos;t hi@@ re you ?
do you watch television ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ os@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very com@@ fortable .
the cri@@ min@@ al is sure to do time for ro@@ b@@ b@@ ing the store .
my children are hungry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is hon@@ est .
her beli@@ ef in God is very fir@@ m .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ts d@@ ai@@ ly experience .
Tom began to shi@@ ver viol@@ ently .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he fai@@ led .
he should get to your house in an hour .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you forgot to practi@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess it is light out .
I didn &apos;t mo@@ ve a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these fo@@ ss@@ ils are the &apos; smoking gun &apos; just before the em@@ erg@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
how far do we have to go ?
children g@@ row very quickly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ th@@ em@@ ati@@ cs , being after all a produc@@ t of hu@@ man thought in@@ de@@ pend@@ ent of experience , is so admi@@ r@@ ab@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ ted to the objec@@ ts of re@@ ality ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .
which co@@ lo@@ r do you prefer , blu@@ e or gre@@ en ?
the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es cer@@ em@@ on@@ i@@ ously cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the tri@@ um@@ p@@ h of nation@@ alis@@ m , do@@ ping and com@@ mer@@ ce .
in the val@@ le@@ y , the vi@@ o@@ let@@ s came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ land .
her sk@@ in was almost trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is smart .
let us sing a s@@ ong .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ine logi@@ c is not always log@@ ical .
when we started out , our band could only find small clu@@ b@@ s in small ci@@ ties that would hi@@ re us .
you should respect the ru@@ les your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw Layla hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll l@@ end it to you .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
qu@@ it talking , will you ?
they set out for New York .
I des@@ pi@@ se them .
my cat slept next to me .
for@@ give me .
the floor is co@@ ver@@ ed with a th@@ ic@@ k car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ ar@@ m not far from Boston .
an animal can be much more dangerous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you drive a sti@@ ck shi@@ ft ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
Dan par@@ ked the r@@ ent@@ al car near the police station .
where do you want to go for our first les@@ son ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ dered why Mary had stayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of attr@@ ac@@ ting more Japanese spea@@ k@@ ers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ ounds to his ambi@@ tion .
P@@ in@@ ea@@ p@@ ple is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ broken .
how did it come about ?
whose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this movie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lucky to be ali@@ ve .
you can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the l@@ ake , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
gi@@ ving up smoking is the eas@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it th@@ ous@@ and@@ s of times .
the dog is thir@@ st@@ y .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been prom@@ o@@ ted to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you mean , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fi@@ ght .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ anger .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mist@@ a@@ ken as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she loved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I plea@@ ded not gu@@ il@@ ty .
we can &apos;t pos@@ t@@ po@@ ne the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invited .
long live the ger@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the piano .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but rather out of absent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to str@@ ang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ l@@ ection for be@@ ef .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be crazy to believe such n@@ on@@ sense .
I want you to be quiet .
C@@ o@@ tt@@ on ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on Sun@@ day .
you guys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to cook for us ?
what language were they speaking ?
never tell lies .
both al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves are possible .
maybe I should also ad@@ d sentences without transl@@ ations ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the popul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to bet on that ?
we made sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve cho@@ s@@ en her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kiss you the way you want to be kis@@ sed .
stop twi@@ sting my ar@@ m !
if he s@@ ends me any let@@ ters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .
I was war@@ ned .
sooner or later , Tom will li@@ k@@ ely agree to help us .
this is longer than any other bri@@ dge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher ex@@ plain@@ ing ?
we &apos;d like se@@ par@@ ate ch@@ ec@@ ks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cro@@ s@@ sing the bor@@ der .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re war@@ m enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors are . our pap@@ ers got lost du@@ ring the F@@ lo@@ od .
sit down and sh@@ ut up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the men@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the super@@ market .
D@@ ro@@ pl@@ ets are fall@@ ing on my lap@@ top computer .
I am sure .
I believe him to be intelligent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a m@@ ember .
this kind of work makes me hungry .
smoking is bad for your health .
In@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f to@@ s@@ sing is an O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c sport !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your promis@@ es .
I just want to be perf@@ ect .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to envir@@ on@@ ment@@ al chang@@ es .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to Americ@@ a .
I don &apos;t have much inter@@ est in co@@ o@@ king .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your team .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a fi@@ ght with me ?
his kin@@ d@@ ness tou@@ ched my heart .
he stu@@ di@@ es bi@@ o@@ log@@ y very hard .
my uncle is rich .
to be perf@@ ect she l@@ acked just one de@@ f@@ ect .
I hear him fall@@ ing .
you don &apos;t have to be a vic@@ ti@@ m .
which way is the b@@ each ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more ri@@ ce , please ?
don &apos;t talk ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish !
Sami lived very close to the lo@@ c@@ ation where Layla &apos;s body was found .
the susp@@ ect is a cau@@ cas@@ i@@ an fem@@ ale .
he pain@@ ted a dog .
where did you hi@@ de the food ?
I get ch@@ app@@ ed li@@ ps every winter .
they dec@@ ei@@ ved us .
my fe@@ et are cold .
Mary accep@@ ted everything without compl@@ ain@@ ing .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our es@@ cap@@ e was nothing short of a mi@@ rac@@ le .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I surviv@@ ed .
this glass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to cho@@ ose .
my dog has canc@@ er .
do you remember the day this picture was taken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the test .
can I speak to you a moment ?
they stood on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your favorite sk@@ in care produc@@ t ?
you can b@@ orrow three books at a time .
I &apos;m in absolu@@ tel@@ y to@@ t@@ al agre@@ ement .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody needs to know this .
fall is late this year .
they &apos;re on good ter@@ ms with their neigh@@ b@@ ors .
I &apos;m using a new computer .
Mary always stu@@ di@@ es for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a ru@@ le .
who are you clo@@ s@@ est to in your family ?
you &apos;re worse than Tom .
do the Ger@@ m@@ ans have any other concer@@ n@@ s in life a@@ part from con@@ su@@ mer@@ is@@ m ?
you should not respect a man because he is rich .
the ch@@ air cre@@ a@@ ked as he s@@ at down .
he ex@@ press@@ ed his beli@@ ef in her hon@@ es@@ ty .
only they th@@ em@@ sel@@ ves understand what they say .
no , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was crying for her mother .
they ru@@ ined it .
they want p@@ ea@@ ce .
are we being char@@ g@@ ed with something ?
I really hate d@@ ai@@ ry produc@@ ts .
I was right on the spo@@ t when it happened .
be pun@@ ctu@@ al .
I am four@@ te@@ en years old .
you look so p@@ ale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ v@@ ar@@ k is a me@@ di@@ um @-@ si@@ zed animal .
the school ru@@ les requ@@ ire students to wear school uni@@ form@@ s .
where can I buy books ?
I have two eyes .
I &apos;ve re@@ mo@@ ved the com@@ ma .
do you have an ex@@ tra key ?
his bad le@@ g pre@@ v@@ ented him from win@@ ning the ra@@ ce .
you &apos;re being par@@ an@@ o@@ id .
I &apos;m lucky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I admire her efforts .
we can &apos;t get close to the en@@ em@@ y .
there are a lot of stars lar@@ ger than our own S@@ un .
they aren &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to nor@@ mal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good cook .
are you watching the pres@@ identi@@ al de@@ b@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .
who sp@@ read these rum@@ ours ?
that was written by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ ag@@ aw@@ a .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you consi@@ dered me a close friend .
things will only get worse .
the girl is drin@@ king te@@ a .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your faul@@ t .
she met him on the b@@ each .
they arrived at the hotel .
is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had gotten no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ p@@ ping off du@@ ring the meeting .
haven &apos;t you eaten yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about reli@@ gi@@ on .
who is there ?
he is str@@ on@@ ger than me .
I sw@@ o@@ re I &apos;d never do that .
the dog came running to me .
Tom is th@@ ro@@ wing st@@ ones at bir@@ ds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ach .
she died last night .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child l@@ ab@@ or .
death before di@@ sh@@ on@@ or !
I o@@ il@@ ed my bicycle .
turn around .
this is not necessary .
we want re@@ ven@@ ge .
put on your shoes . let &apos;s go out for dinner .
you &apos;re fai@@ th@@ ful .
the train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
this show is stupid .
write Spanish .
don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it s@@ no@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not writing about you .
your question is not rel@@ ev@@ ant to the sub@@ ject .
she came to see me .
this ch@@ air is too small .
how much time do you actually spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the do@@ ors of per@@ c@@ ep@@ tion were cle@@ an@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
beer is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the porter for car@@ r@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great thin@@ k@@ ers who were un@@ known while ali@@ ve became famous after death .
you &apos;re a terrible person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the s@@ pu@@ r of the moment .
in N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are gener@@ ally sil@@ ent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat cand@@ y just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some inside information about the company &apos;s pl@@ ans to go public .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no sooner had he seen it than he turned p@@ ale .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I appreciate the senti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
finish drin@@ king your milk .
the old man died from hun@@ ger .
20@@ 1@@ 6 is coming to an end and a new year is about to beg@@ in !
you &apos;re the ol@@ d@@ est .
I slept for ei@@ ght hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like music ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I or@@ dered .
this is such a was@@ te of time .
Tom is always playing video gam@@ es .
I have been to the store before .
stop s@@ end@@ ing me flowers .
please un@@ dress from the wai@@ st up .
that &apos;s a stupid question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ st@@ er your produc@@ t ?
Dan had to dec@@ ide wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ heal@@ thy .
there is a television in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to clean the house .
I haven &apos;t used An@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds due .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had g@@ ath@@ ered outside the cour@@ th@@ ouse .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the c@@ ap off this bo@@ ttle .
I reco@@ gni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
Al@@ th@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is conten@@ ted .
I was bo@@ red .
if I were heal@@ thy , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thir@@ st@@ y .
have fun with that .
there is something tr@@ op@@ ical and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which form@@ s a sin@@ gu@@ l@@ ar contr@@ ast to her cool and un@@ em@@ o@@ tion@@ al brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would listen to me .
I can &apos;t prove it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ v@@ el I can b@@ orrow ?
you have changed since I saw you last year .
e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e , catch a ti@@ ger by his to@@ e , if he ho@@ ll@@ ers let him go , e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to catch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stupid ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the sof@@ a .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shirt .
it &apos;s easy to have a clear con@@ science when it &apos;s not used .
are you ve@@ get@@ ari@@ an ?
if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ k@@ ers are against the new plan .
they stayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to sort this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s strong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .
are you b@@ lowing me off ?
I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated a student &apos;s phone because he was tex@@ ting in class .
J@@ im hasn &apos;t come yet .
do you want something cold to drink ?
P@@ re@@ histo@@ ri@@ c men were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .
we should h@@ ang out .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I didn &apos;t hear a s@@ pl@@ as@@ h .
I don &apos;t mind l@@ end@@ ing you the money pro@@ vi@@ ded you pay it back with@@ in a month .
Ah ... ok@@ ay , I was young , but what a stupid mistake !
in fact , I should thank you for this .
I was ar@@ res@@ ted on the spo@@ t .
I &apos;m studying art at school .
that never was an issu@@ e .
you should really l@@ ay off that . it &apos;ll ru@@ in your health .
the medic@@ ine had no eff@@ ect .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ kes .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a ser@@ ies of tu@@ bes .
Tom is here somewhere .
Tom stood very close to Mary .
he re@@ main@@ ed sil@@ ent the whole time .
Tom &apos;s French pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thinks it is .
will they el@@ ect him for four more years ?
I got up too early .
since it rain@@ ed , I stayed home .
Tom put a st@@ ar on top of the Christmas tree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I w@@ ake up at 7 o &apos;clock .
they have a plan .
Tom did a good job .
Tom never said he wanted to go with us .
do you want some sugar in your coffee ?
are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
we &apos;re under att@@ ack !
it &apos;s very late .
the whole village knows the man well .
are you up for it ?
bi@@ te the bu@@ ll@@ et .
I went to bed at tw@@ el@@ ve last night .
the eff@@ ect was imme@@ di@@ ate .
Mary has a new lo@@ ver .
what co@@ lo@@ r is Mary &apos;s scar@@ f ?
may I eat another pie@@ ce of cake ?
you never get a second chance to make a first impres@@ sion .
he &apos;s all@@ er@@ gi@@ c to cats .
get on your k@@ ne@@ es .
is there a problem I should know about ?
Dan is now wanted by the police .
you &apos;d better tell the truth .
it was rain@@ ing heav@@ ily when I got up this morning .
I called her , but the line was busy .
I have a coat , but I don &apos;t have a hat .
I can &apos;t leave off smoking .
you are was@@ hing di@@ sh@@ es .
this won &apos;t solve anything .
sometimes T@@ on@@ y vis@@ ited his family .
arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al intelli@@ g@@ ence can now coll@@ ect information from soci@@ al me@@ di@@ a and the inter@@ n@@ et to help des@@ ign@@ ers understand what the public likes .
I love to travel .
Tom has a b@@ right car@@ e@@ er as a medic@@ al doctor .
C@@ ro@@ w@@ ds f@@ illed the stre@@ ets car@@ r@@ ying ban@@ n@@ ers .
Oh ! mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous !
I learned it from you .
J@@ im seems to know the art of making friends with girls .
tell me exactly where he lives .
ch@@ ic@@ ken po@@ x is a com@@ mon si@@ ck@@ ness in children .
I can &apos;t tell you exactly how long it will take .
H@@ ence , lo@@ ath@@ ed m@@ el@@ an@@ cho@@ ly .
I was bo@@ red because I had seen the movie before .
I believe that story .
Tom &apos;s grand@@ mother looks heal@@ thy .
they &apos;re all in there .
many years ago fl@@ ying used to be gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous . now it &apos;s just a pain in the nec@@ k !
I admire your pers@@ ever@@ ance and det@@ ermin@@ ation .
he gave her a p@@ eck on the ch@@ ee@@ k .
our gu@@ es@@ ts are in a hurry .
he went to bed .
which one should I use ?
Tom introdu@@ ced Mary to his mother .
in Europe , people reg@@ ard pun@@ ctu@@ ality as a matter of course .
get a room already !
most of these are mine .
Tom &apos;s dog has four legs .
many young people are out of work in that country .
why don &apos;t I have a boy@@ friend ?
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
we had to make a dec@@ ision .
B@@ ri@@ l@@ li@@ ant !
I think this is bes@@ ide the point , right now .
this is a dog .
I need to go sho@@ p@@ ping .
language is the sym@@ bo@@ l of a n@@ ation &apos;s existence .
I have finished my hom@@ e@@ work .
I figured that you &apos;d be im@@ press@@ ed .
it sm@@ el@@ ls del@@ ici@@ ous .
it is two o &apos;clock in the morning .
I miss you .
I am a cat . I don &apos;t have a name yet .
you can &apos;t have your cake and eat it .
just as I thought something was ru@@ st@@ ling there , a cat lea@@ ped out of the bus@@ h .
this place is p@@ acked !
I really like that gu@@ y .
they speak French in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
a black and wh@@ ite dog bit me .
the ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens immediately pre@@ pared everything to de@@ f@@ end the city .
I &apos;m going to join a dem@@ on@@ str@@ ation .
I had a good sleep last night .
come on , T@@ on@@ y .
I don &apos;t feel so spec@@ i@@ al .
Tom is resp@@ ected by everybody .
this book is much more us@@ eful than that one .
A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice wel@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
someone spi@@ ked her drink .
if he &apos;s still ali@@ ve , he &apos;d be very old by now .
would you trust them ?
I wish I could live in a house that nice .
how long have you been div@@ or@@ ced ?
I &apos;m what the world call@@ s an idiot .
that seems like a lot .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
it &apos;s a little cold today .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
where exactly do you live ?
I went to the post office .
I &apos;d like to wel@@ come you all abo@@ ard .
I will let you know in adv@@ ance .
he is mil@@ es away .
what a wonder@@ ful morning ! I feel on top of the world .
I can &apos;t help myself .
I was there last night .
they who dre@@ am by day are co@@ gni@@ z@@ ant of many things which es@@ cap@@ e those who dre@@ am only by night .
are you sure that you want to go there ?
he went back home .
this morning the weather is cl@@ ou@@ dy .

please do as it seems best to you .
Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants .
the libr@@ ari@@ an said we needed to be quiet .
B@@ ern@@ ard of Ch@@ ar@@ tres used to say that we are like d@@ war@@ fs on the sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s of gi@@ ants , so that we can see more than they , and things at a gre@@ ater distance , not by vir@@ tu@@ e of any sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ness of sight on our part , or any physi@@ cal dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion , but because we are c@@ arried high and rais@@ ed up by their gi@@ ant si@@ ze .

does Tom know why he &apos;s coming here ?
what is the ac@@ tive in@@ gre@@ di@@ ent in as@@ pi@@ ri@@ n ?
that couple was made for each other .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here again .
Oh cr@@ ap , it &apos;s past the con@@ su@@ me @-@ by date . that &apos;s why you thre@@ w up !
he felt in his po@@ cket for his w@@ all@@ et .
I dou@@ b@@ t everything , even my own dou@@ b@@ ts .
a sai@@ lo@@ r is at sea much of the time .
you &apos;re not safe here .

don &apos;t they drive you m@@ ad ?
he felt a sh@@ ar@@ p pain .
R@@ e@@ pres@@ ent@@ ati@@ ves from many coun@@ tri@@ es have parti@@ cip@@ ated in this con@@ fer@@ ence .
do you think the situation will im@@ prove ?
life is hard .
F@@ ur@@ ry r@@ ab@@ b@@ its are so cute .
I haven &apos;t gotten p@@ aid yet .
you would be sav@@ ed a great deal of trouble .
I couldn &apos;t have done that by myself .

try to sleep .
keep Tom safe .
I wish she &apos;d stop smoking .

he &apos;s trying hard .
father is angry with me .
it &apos;s already 1@@ 1 .
speaking French is difficult .

show me how to do this .
they like to dance .
Tom bought some cr@@ out@@ ons .
I &apos;m glad that makes you happy .
the ma@@ jo@@ ri@@ ty ignor@@ es that which has no name , and the ma@@ jo@@ ri@@ ty believ@@ es in the existence of all that has a name .
how are you g@@ onn@@ a deal with it ?
I was im@@ press@@ ed with her work .
I per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed my mother to l@@ end me her car .
this bre@@ ad is hard as a rock .
you were pre@@ tend@@ ing , weren &apos;t you ?
we &apos;re out of danger .
I read it in a magazine .
stop it right now !
don &apos;t go in that building .
we lost .
please feel free to make sugg@@ es@@ tions .
his death has left a vac@@ u@@ um in their lives .
the police off@@ ic@@ er put hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s on the susp@@ ect .
it &apos;s a nice day , isn &apos;t it ? why not go out for a walk ?
I am surprised to learn this .
our car is e@@ qui@@ pped with air condi@@ tion@@ ing .
that &apos;s bes@@ ide the point .
she ba@@ ked a p@@ ie .
Tom seems young .
what does any of that have to do with me ?
she dis@@ liked her husband .
I was able to do it .
I don &apos;t want to see her n@@ a@@ ked .
trav@@ el@@ ing is easy these days .
Tom bought three bo@@ tt@@ les of red wine .
what &apos;s wrong with being n@@ a@@ ked ?
Tom is fi@@ gh@@ ting canc@@ er .
why don &apos;t you eat ve@@ get@@ ables ?
I &apos;ll write to you soon .
I love you so much . I can &apos;t wait to see you .
there are many fruit vend@@ ors on the way .
I haven &apos;t seen you in don@@ key &apos;s years !
you &apos;re very lon@@ ely .
there is no r@@ ush .
when the school had no books or paper or pen@@ c@@ ils , she wrote the al@@ ph@@ ab@@ et on the gr@@ ound with a sti@@ ck .
he stop@@ ped drin@@ king .
he is not what he used to be .
did Tom call you last night ?
are you busy Fri@@ day night ?
I talked to her .
this is ex@@ trem@@ ely important .
you &apos;re not supposed to eat on the job .
he &apos;s smart and ambi@@ ti@@ ous .
the con@@ fus@@ ion beg@@ gar@@ s des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
don &apos;t be in such a hurry .
he drin@@ ks too much coffee .
maybe we should just give up .
I thought you were seri@@ ous .
I &apos;ve done a really stupid thing .
how do you say that in French ?
her new nov@@ el has become a best sel@@ ler .
you go@@ tt@@ a get more organ@@ i@@ zed .
a mother kis@@ sed the child .
I &apos;ve got a ton of hom@@ e@@ work .
when Tom spoke , they all re@@ main@@ ed sil@@ ent .
French is fas@@ cin@@ ating .
you &apos;re plan@@ ning something , aren &apos;t you ?
you should listen to his advice .
pri@@ ces are double what they were ten years ago .
they &apos;re early .
Tom always had to win .
you should stop .
Tom pre@@ tend@@ ed he had a gun .
as soon as I have it , I &apos;ll forward it to you .
this is for your prot@@ ection .
this is our only hope .
I think we should s@@ ell our old car .
I realize that there &apos;s a problem .
like a lea@@ f in the au@@ tu@@ m@@ n bre@@ e@@ ze .
the t@@ one of do@@ g@@ mati@@ s@@ m is in@@ spi@@ red by prof@@ ound ignor@@ ance .
Tom has a M@@ ac@@ book .
P@@ hi@@ li@@ p , like An@@ dre@@ w and P@@ et@@ er , was from the town of B@@ e@@ th@@ es@@ da .
a great number of ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens went into the ar@@ my .
I appreciate your advice .
he off@@ ered me to go to the the@@ ater , but there weren &apos;t any perf@@ om@@ ances on that night .
turn to the right .
she is a p@@ sy@@ chi@@ c .
he never goes out after dark .
I &apos;m ad@@ dic@@ ted to ni@@ co@@ t@@ ine .
I want a room with two be@@ ds .
these arti@@ cles cannot be ex@@ changed .
I just met the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
excuse me , I &apos;m lost .
I don &apos;t know where my keys are .
in the P@@ ic@@ ass@@ o M@@ us@@ eu@@ m in Paris , there are mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous pain@@ t@@ ings and dr@@ a@@ win@@ gs !
the U@@ .@@ S@@ . pres@@ ident &apos;s pass@@ port is black , not blu@@ e like an av@@ er@@ age ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en &apos;s .
this could have un@@ in@@ tend@@ ed conse@@ qu@@ ences .
who does she think she is ?
Tom dec@@ lin@@ ed to comment .
we have consi@@ dered your propos@@ al , and we have decided that we are not able to re@@ du@@ ce the price .
canc@@ el that .
those were his actu@@ al words .
we know where he is .
R@@ e@@ peti@@ tion is the mother of all learning .
this car run@@ s on al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
keep the dog out .
I like these ch@@ airs .
are you coming in or not ?
I &apos;m about to go out .
you can &apos;t help him .
I remember the war@@ m@@ th of his ar@@ ms .
why are you really doing this ?
you &apos;re very cl@@ ever .
I &apos;ll sleep on the fu@@ ton .
Tom is not a her@@ o .
you &apos;re blo@@ c@@ king my view .
that &apos;s not good .
we could &apos;ve hel@@ ped Tom .
Mary opened her pu@@ r@@ se and looked around in it .
I &apos;ve thought about it , and what we &apos;re doing is just not right , so let &apos;s break up after today .
you don &apos;t seem very pleased .
why don &apos;t you see for yourself ?
have you put on sun@@ s@@ cre@@ en ?
let &apos;s play ch@@ ess another time .
I &apos;ve never had a traffic accident .
a kiss is the best way to keep sil@@ ent while saying it all .
with this tal@@ is@@ man , you can ward off any and all ev@@ il spi@@ ri@@ ts .
Tom has no money at all .
Tom has never d@@ anced with Mary .
I want to talk to her .
you ought to have been more careful .
they &apos;re just students .
I believ@@ ed you .
where exactly did you go ?
I have been sil@@ ent for a long time .
I think he &apos;s happy .
nobody can believe in you more than yourself .
you &apos;re res@@ our@@ c@@ eful .
have you ever sli@@ pped on a ban@@ an@@ a pe@@ el ?
I &apos;ll probably come by c@@ a@@ b .
she &apos;s in@@ sec@@ ure .
I &apos;m not in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble .
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on the pic@@ ni@@ c with him .
come over here and sit down .
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
I bought a watch and an em@@ p@@ ty box .
he &apos;s ru@@ th@@ less .
I slept very well last night .
it is gener@@ ally hard to ad@@ ap@@ t to living in a fore@@ ig@@ n cul@@ ture .
R@@ ev@@ en@@ ues are gro@@ wing , but not as fast as co@@ sts .
hi , S@@ us@@ an . how are you ?
I was wonder@@ ing why you weren &apos;t here .
I will give you this book .
S@@ on@@ ia was a cute little br@@ un@@ ette , with so@@ ft eyes , sh@@ ado@@ wed by long l@@ as@@ h@@ es .
this l@@ ake is priv@@ ate . f@@ is@@ hing here is for@@ bi@@ dd@@ en .
I could never do that .
he stood with his fe@@ et a@@ part .
after a bit of go@@ o@@ gl@@ ing , I susp@@ ect that what you said may not be true .
the cir@@ c@@ us is in town .
Tom is wor@@ ried sick about Mary .
I &apos;d like to gr@@ adu@@ ate next spring .
the go@@ ods were trans@@ por@@ ted by shi@@ p .
where was this picture taken ?
she always arriv@@ es on time .
I have nothing to bo@@ ast about .
he is very angry .
as I turned the hand@@ le of the cr@@ an@@ k@@ sh@@ af@@ t , the old tr@@ ac@@ tor s@@ pu@@ t@@ tered to life .
a few seri@@ ous problems rem@@ ain .
the hor@@ se is neigh@@ ing .
I have finished .
try to be more pun@@ ctu@@ al from now on .
all ma@@ j@@ or cre@@ dit car@@ ds are accep@@ ted .
in En@@ gl@@ and the wai@@ ter asked us , &quot; H@@ o@@ w much beer would you like , a half p@@ int or a p@@ int ? &quot; having no idea how much that would be , we asked him to show us the glasses .
the scienti@@ sts have not found any ex@@ plan@@ ation for the my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
that &apos;s your half .
Tom has cut his fin@@ ger .
we chose a hotel near the sub@@ way .
the dog is sleeping at the fo@@ ot of the bed .
Tom came up with an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
the cri@@ ti@@ cs shot us down .
Tom has to learn Japanese because he &apos;s going to Japan next year .
